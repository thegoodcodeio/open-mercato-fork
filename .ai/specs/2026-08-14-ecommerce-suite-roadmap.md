## TLDR

**Key Points:**
- Open Mercato has the back-office half of commerce (`catalog`, `sales`, `wms`, `payment_gateways`, `shipping_carriers`, `customers`, `customer_accounts`) but no selling channel. SPEC-029 tried to close the gap with one 1892-line spec covering a backend module, a public API, a checkout state machine and a complete Next.js application at once.
- This roadmap replaces that monolith with **twelve scoped specs across seven new modules**, fixes the ownership boundaries between them, and records the architecture decisions that the individual specs must not re-litigate.
- The load-bearing correction: **the cart is a first-class, channel-agnostic module** (`cart`), not a status on a checkout session. Storefront, POS, pay links and AI agents all mutate the same cart contract; checkout consumes a cart and turns it into a `SalesOrder`.
- **B2B is in scope from v1.** Catalog pricing already resolves `customer_id` / `customer_group_id` / quantity tiers / validity windows — the missing pieces are the `CustomerGroup` entity itself (today a dangling UUID column), credit limits, and buyer approval flow.

**Scope:**
- Module inventory, ownership boundaries and dependency direction for the ecommerce suite
- Twelve specs: what each owns, what it must not own, and in which order they land
- Nine architecture decisions (ADR-1 … ADR-9) binding on every downstream spec
- Phasing with explicit gating criteria

**Concerns:**
- `customer_group_id` is referenced by `catalog` pricing and `sales` tax rates with no owning table — every B2B feature is blocked on closing that first
- Two competing checkout models exist (SPEC-029 §19 vs. the `@open-mercato/checkout` package); one must be retired explicitly, not left to drift
- Cart totals must flow through `salesCalculationService` or storefront and back-office will disagree on tax, which is a correctness bug, not a cosmetic one

---

## 1) Overview

This is an umbrella specification. It contains no implementable work of its own. It defines the module set that constitutes Open Mercato's ecommerce capability, assigns ownership of every domain concept to exactly one module, fixes the dependency direction between them, and sequences the child specs.

Every child spec in the suite MUST conform to the decisions recorded in §5. A child spec that needs to deviate MUST amend this document first.

---

## 2) Problem Statement

### 2.1 The capability gap

The platform sells nothing. There is no public channel through which a customer can browse an assortment, assemble an order and pay for it. Each of the pieces required to build such a channel exists, but nothing composes them:

| Capability | Owner today | Usable by a storefront? |
|---|---|---|
| Products, variants, categories, option schemas | `catalog` | Yes, via internal APIs only |
| Price resolution incl. customer/group/quantity scoping | `catalog/lib/pricing.ts` | Yes, but no public contract |
| Orders, quotes, tax rates, shipping & payment methods, totals | `sales` | Yes, via commands |
| Stock balances and reservations | `wms` | No availability contract exposed |
| Customer identity for a public visitor | `customer_accounts` | Yes (`CustomerUser`, portal sessions) |
| Domain → tenant routing | `customer_accounts.DomainMapping` | Yes |
| Payment execution | `payment_gateways`, `gateway-stripe` | Yes |
| Assembling a basket | — | **Nothing owns this** |
| Discount evaluation | — | **Spec only** (SPEC-055) |
| Store configuration & branding | — | **Spec only** (SPEC-029) |

### 2.2 Why SPEC-029 cannot be implemented as written

SPEC-029 is a good design document and a bad unit of work.

1. **It spans four deliverables in one document** — a backend module (§6–7, §13), a public API surface (§9, §12), a checkout state machine (§19), and a complete Next.js application including its design system, WCAG compliance and responsive strategy (§14–18). These have different reviewers, different risk profiles and different release cadences.
2. **It models the cart as a checkout session status** (§7.4: *"The checkout session is also the cart. There is no separate cart entity."*). This makes the basket a property of one channel's funnel. POS (SPEC-022), pay links (`@open-mercato/checkout`) and AI purchasing agents each need a basket, and under this model each must either invent its own or borrow the storefront's checkout entity.
3. **It collides with a shipped package.** `@open-mercato/checkout` Phase A is implemented (`CheckoutLinkTemplate`, `CheckoutLink`, `CheckoutTransaction`); Phase B specifies `CheckoutCartItem` plus quote→order conversion. SPEC-029 §19 specifies a parallel session→order path via `workflows`. Two checkout models, both unimplemented past Phase A, both claiming order creation.
4. **It duplicates domain lifecycle management.** `EcommerceStoreDomain` (§7.2) proposes `tls_mode` and `verification_status` alongside the existing `customer_accounts.DomainMapping`, which already carries provider, DNS verification state, TLS failure reasons, retry counters and supersession chains.
5. **It invents availability from nothing.** `availability: 'in_stock' | 'out_of_stock' | 'backorder'` appears in three payload types (§8.4, §8.5, §9.1) with no stated source. `wms` owns `InventoryBalance` and `InventoryReservation`; no contract connects them.
6. **It has no promotions integration**, while SPEC-055 is written against a `cart` module that does not exist and that SPEC-029 does not create.
7. **It is B2C-shaped.** No customer-contract pricing, no quantity break UI, no purchase-on-account, no buyer approval — despite `catalog` already resolving customer-scoped prices.

## 3) Module Inventory

### 3.1 New modules

All new modules live in `packages/core/src/modules/<module>/` and follow the standard module layout.

| Module | Owns | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| `ecommerce` | Store definition, hostname→store binding, sales-channel binding, buyer-context resolution, branding, public read API surface | Cart state, checkout funnel, order creation, product domain model |
| `cart` | `Cart`, `CartLine`, line pricing snapshots, totals, promotion effect application, TTL and abandonment, guest→customer merge | Addresses, shipping selection, payment, order creation, product domain model |
| `promotions` | Promotion rule tree, benefits, codes, usage ledger, evaluation engine | Cart mutation, totals arithmetic, order creation |
| `customer_groups` | `CustomerGroup`, group membership, group-scoped commercial terms, credit limit and exposure, buyer approval policy | Price rows (owned by `catalog`), tax rates (owned by `sales`) |
| `merchandising` | Storefront navigation menus, homepage/landing blocks, banners, category enrichment, curated product sets, cross/upsell rules | Product domain model, CMS pages (owned by `content`) |
| `availability` | The `availabilityService` DI contract and its catalog-only fallback implementation | Stock movements, lots, reservations (owned by `wms`) |
| `pricing` (optional) | A resolver registered into `catalog`'s existing resolver chain, taking over price resolution when installed | Price rows and the base resolver (both owned by `catalog`); discount effects (`promotions`); totals (`sales`) |

### 3.2 Extended existing modules

| Module | Extension |
|---|---|
| `@open-mercato/checkout` | Becomes the single checkout funnel for every channel, consuming a `cart` rather than owning line items |
| `customer_accounts` | Storefront-facing account area: order history, address book, saved carts, shopping lists, B2B buyer roster |
| `wms` | Registers the concrete `availabilityService` implementation backed by `InventoryBalance` / `InventoryReservation` |
| `catalog` | Admin UI for customer/group/quantity-scoped price rows (the data model already supports them) |
| `sales` | Order creation entrypoint used by checkout; purchase-on-account payment method |
| `packages/shared` | Two dependency-free contracts consumed across the suite: `lib/availability/` (base availability query/result types, provider registry, catalog-only fallback) and `lib/catalog-visibility/` (`AssortmentScope`, `EffectiveAssortmentScope`, and the pure `matchesOne`/`matchesScope`/`unionScopes`/`intersectScopes` combinators) |

### 3.3 New application

| App | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `apps/storefront` | Reference Next.js storefront consuming only the public `ecommerce` API surface |

```

**Rules:**
- Arrows are one-directional. `catalog` MUST NOT know about `cart`; `cart` MUST NOT know about `checkout`.
- Every cross-module edge is an FK id plus a DI-resolved service call. No cross-module ORM relations (root `AGENTS.md`).
- `ecommerce` never mutates. Every write path in the suite goes through `cart` or `checkout`.

---

## 5) Architecture Decisions

### ADR-1 — The cart is a module, not a checkout status

**Decision.** `cart` owns `Cart` and `CartLine` as first-class entities. A cart is identified by an opaque token, is channel-tagged, and outlives any single funnel.

**Rationale.** Four channels need a basket: storefront, POS (SPEC-022), pay links, and AI purchasing agents (`catalog` already ships mutation-approval tooling). A basket bound to a checkout entity forces three of them to duplicate line management, price snapshotting and promotion evaluation.

**Consequence.** SPEC-029 §7.4 `EcommerceCheckoutSession.line_snapshot` is withdrawn. Checkout holds `cart_id`, not lines.

**Rejected alternative.** Cart-as-session (SPEC-029 as written) — simpler by one entity, but pushes basket logic into every channel. Also rejected: extending `CheckoutCartItem` from the pay-links package, because that model was shaped by merchant-defined static link contents, not shopper-mutable baskets.

---

### ADR-2 — `cart` never computes tax or totals itself

**Decision.** `cart` resolves unit prices via `catalogPricingService`, resolves discounts via `promotionsService`, and then delegates all totalling — tax, rounding, adjustments, currency — to `salesCalculationService`.

**Rationale.** A storefront total that disagrees with the order it produces is a correctness defect with financial and legal consequences (invoice mismatch, Omnibus disclosure, VAT). `sales` already owns `SalesTaxRate` and the calculation service used by every back-office document.

**Consequence.** `cart` depends on `sales` for calculation. This is the one place where a read-side module depends on the transactional core; it is deliberate and must not be worked around by reimplementing arithmetic.

---

### ADR-3 — Checkout is one funnel, owned by `@open-mercato/checkout`

**Decision.** The `@open-mercato/checkout` package is the sole owner of the checkout funnel for all channels. SPEC-029 §19 (workflow-driven `EcommerceCheckoutSession`) is withdrawn. The Simple Checkout spec is rewritten to consume a `cart` instead of defining `CheckoutCartItem`.

**Rationale.** Two unimplemented checkout models both claiming order creation is a guaranteed divergence. Pay links Phase A already ships in this package with a working transaction and payment-callback path; that is the code with production evidence.

**Consequence.** A checkout session references `cart_id`. Locking a cart for checkout is a `cart` state transition requested by `checkout`, not a status owned by `checkout`.

**Open point for the child spec.** Whether the funnel's step machine uses the `workflows` module (SPEC-029's proposal, giving configurable per-store checkout steps) or a fixed state machine. Configurability has real B2B value (approval steps, PO number capture); the child spec decides and justifies.

---

### ADR-4 — Availability is a contract, `wms` is one implementation

**Decision.** The suite depends on an `availabilityService` contract, not on `wms`:

```typescript
type AvailabilityQuery = {
  tenantId: string
  organizationId: string
  items: Array<{ catalogProductId: string; catalogVariantId?: string | null; quantity: number }>
  channelId?: string | null
  locationIds?: string[] | null
}

type AvailabilityResult = {
  byItem: Record<string, {
    state: 'in_stock' | 'low_stock' | 'out_of_stock' | 'backorder' | 'preorder' | 'not_tracked'
    availableQuantity: number | null   // null = not tracked
    leadTimeDays: number | null
    canFulfil: boolean
    isAuthoritative: boolean           // false for a cached browse-time read
  }>
}
```

Field names are `catalogProductId` / `catalogVariantId`, matching the `catalog_product_id` / `catalog_variant_id` convention `wms`'s own entities already use. `isAuthoritative` is required because a browse-time read may be up to 60s stale and no caller may treat it as a stock guarantee — only the reservation call is authoritative.

`wms` registers the authoritative implementation (`InventoryBalance` minus open `InventoryReservation`) into an explicit provider registry, by id, rather than relying on module load order. A built-in catalog-only fallback reports `not_tracked` so a storefront works without `wms` installed, and the `availability` module owns the sell-policy layer (`AvailabilityPolicy`) and the reservation lifecycle on top. **Spec 2 owns the canonical shape and location of these types**; this ADR fixes the decision, not the definition.

**Rationale.** Storefront and cart must not query WMS entities directly — that would be a hard dependency on a module many tenants do not run, and a cross-module ORM coupling.

**Consequence.** SPEC-029's three inline `availability` unions are replaced by this contract's `state`. `low_stock` and `preorder` are added; the storefront needs them and they cost nothing now.

---

### ADR-5 — `ecommerce` binds hostnames, `customer_accounts` owns them

**Decision.** SPEC-029's `EcommerceStoreDomain` is reduced to a binding row (`store_id`, `domain_mapping_id`, `is_primary`, `path_prefix`). DNS verification, TLS provisioning, provider selection and supersession stay in `customer_accounts.DomainMapping`.

**Rationale.** `DomainMapping` already implements the hard part — provider abstraction (`traefik`), `verified_at`, `last_dns_check_at`, `dns_failure_reason`, `tls_failure_reason`, `tls_retry_count`, `replaces_domain_id`. Reimplementing a subset in `ecommerce` guarantees two divergent verification state machines.

**Consequence.** Store resolution is a two-hop lookup: hostname → `DomainMapping` (tenant/org) → store binding → `EcommerceStore`. The child spec must specify the cache and invalidation for this hop.

---

### ADR-6 — `CustomerGroup` is a real entity, and it is a prerequisite

**Decision.** A `customer_groups` module introduces `CustomerGroup` and `CustomerGroupMembership`, and becomes the owner of the `customer_group_id` UUID that `catalog` and `sales` already reference.

**Rationale.** `customer_group_id` is consumed today by `catalog/lib/pricing.ts` (specificity score +3), `catalog/api/prices`, `catalog/commands/prices.ts`, `catalog` AI price tooling and `SalesTaxRate` — with no table behind it. Every B2B feature in this suite (contract pricing, group tax treatment, credit terms, assortment scoping) resolves through this id. It is the first thing that must land.

**Consequence.** This module ships before `cart`. Backward compatibility: the column stays a plain UUID with no FK constraint added in the first release, so existing rows carrying arbitrary ids keep working; a reconciliation report lists orphans. Adding the constraint is a later, separately-specified migration.

**Scope note.** Credit limit, credit exposure, payment terms and approval policy attach to the group and to `CustomerEntity`. `CustomerCompanyBilling` already carries `payment_terms` and is extended rather than replaced.

---

### ADR-7 — Buyer context is resolved once, at the edge

**Decision.** `ecommerce.storeContext.resolve(request)` returns a `BuyerContext` alongside the store, and every downstream price, tax, assortment and availability call takes it as input:

```typescript
type BuyerContext = {
  customerUserId: string | null      // customer_accounts.CustomerUser
  customerId: string | null          // customers.CustomerEntity
  customerGroupIds: string[]         // customer_groups
  companyId: string | null           // customers.CustomerCompanyProfile
  channelId: string | null           // sales.SalesChannel
  priceKindId: string | null         // catalog.CatalogPriceKind
  currencyCode: string
  locale: string
  taxMode: 'gross' | 'net'           // B2C shows gross, B2B typically net
  purchaseOnAccount: boolean

  // Amended 2026-09-16 — see "Consequence: the digest is decomposable" below.
  // These carry no information the fields above do not already carry. They are the
  // named, independently-hashable projections of it that every cache key, price
  // projection and price-sort path is built from, so that none of them has to key
  // on the whole context as one opaque value.
  assortmentScopeHash: string        // digest of the resolved EffectiveAssortmentScope (spec 12 §3.3)
  priceScopeKey: string              // digest of (channelId, currencyCode, priceKindId, sorted customerGroupIds)
  customerOverlayId: string | null   // customerId, and ONLY when that customer has price rows of their own
}
```

**Rationale.** B2C and B2B differ in *context*, not in code path. Resolving once at the edge means one place to test tenant isolation, and no module re-deriving "is this a B2B buyer" from partial signals.

**Consequence.** Public read endpoints are no longer purely anonymous — an authenticated B2B session changes prices and assortment. Caching keys MUST include the buyer-context digest, and responses for authenticated contexts MUST be marked private. This is a security-relevant requirement, called out in every child spec's risk section.

**Consequence: the digest is decomposable, not opaque (amended 2026-09-16).** "Caching keys MUST include the buyer-context digest" is necessary but not sufficient, and the suite already discovered why in miniature: `storefront-public-api.md` §9.1 had to split `priceRange` out of the facet block because the block was cached at the wrong granularity, and the fix worked only because `assortmentScopeHash` existed as a *named sub-component* of the digest rather than as an opaque whole. That was a reactive, one-off fix. This amendment generalizes it into a rule:

> Every cache key, projection key and index key in this suite MUST be built from one or more of `BuyerContext`'s **named scope components**. No surface may key on a digest of the whole context where a named component would do.

The three components and why the split is exactly there:

| Component | Varies with | Shared between buyers? |
|---|---|---|
| `assortmentScopeHash` | canonicalized **resolved** `EffectiveAssortmentScope` — never its inputs | Yes — every buyer resolving to the same scope, which after spec 12 §3.6 means every buyer without an assortment override of their own |
| `priceScopeKey` | channel, currency, price kind, group set | Yes — this is the bucket ADR-9 materializes |
| `customerOverlayId` | one customer's own contract rows | No — by construction |

The first component carries the same load-bearing property as the third, for the same reason, once spec 12 §3.6 lets a single customer hold an assortment rule of their own: hashing the *resolved* scope keeps every buyer without an override byte-identical to their group and sharing its entries, while hashing any input — `customerId`, the contributing group ids, or a has-override flag — gives every authenticated buyer a private entry and throws the sharing away. Canonicalization (sorted ids, sorted keys, sorted branches) is part of that requirement, since otherwise two identical scopes hash differently whenever their branches arrive in a different group-priority order.

The load-bearing member is the third one's `null`. In B2B the large majority of authenticated buyers have **no** price rows of their own — for pricing purposes they *are* their group, and may share a bucket, a cache entry and a sort order with every other buyer in it. Only buyers with authored contracts need an individual path. A context that cannot express "this buyer has no overlay" forces every authenticated buyer onto the individual path and throws that away.

**How `customerOverlayId` is computed.** `storeContextService.resolve()` runs one `EXISTS` over `catalog_product_variant_prices` filtered by `customer_id`, served by the partial index in `pricing-engine.md` Phase 2b, and caches the boolean per customer with invalidation on `catalog.prices.create/update/delete`. It is a query, not a denormalized column: a stale `has_contract_prices` flag reading `false` would silently serve a contracted buyer their group's prices, which is the same class of disclosure R1 rates Critical, and a flag reading `true` where it should be `false` would quietly cost the sharing win this component exists to buy. One cached `EXISTS` on an index built for it is cheap enough not to trade correctness for.

**Rejected alternative.** Separate `/api/ecommerce/b2b/*` endpoints. Doubles the API surface and the test matrix for what is one resolver difference.

---

### ADR-8 — The storefront shares tokens, not components

**Decision.** `apps/storefront` MUST NOT depend on `@open-mercato/core`. It MAY depend on a new, deliberately small `@open-mercato/storefront-ui` package holding the design tokens and the primitives the storefront actually needs.

**Rationale.** SPEC-029 §14.2 forbids all shared UI, which means reimplementing Button, Badge, Sheet, Dialog, Spinner and their accessibility behaviour a second time. Two independently-maintained accessible dialog implementations is how WCAG regressions ship. The genuine requirement is that the storefront must not pull the back-office bundle — not that it must share no code.

**Consequence.** `@open-mercato/storefront-ui` has a hard size and dependency budget enforced in CI, and MUST NOT import from `@open-mercato/ui`.

---

### ADR-9 — Buyer-scoped prices bucket by group; per-customer contracts are an overlay

*Added 2026-09-16, after an analysis of how this suite's read side behaves once per-customer pricing is actually used.*

**Decision.** When this suite eventually materializes resolved prices — which `storefront-public-api.md` §6.3 already names as the real fix for price sorting and defers to a separate spec — it does so in two pieces with two different cardinalities, and never in one:

1. **Bucket projection.** Key: `(productId, priceScopeKey)`. Cardinality: products × *distinct* `priceScopeKey`s actually in use — channel × currency × price kind × group set. This is the shared, group-level price every buyer without a contract resolves to.
2. **Customer overlay.** Key: `(customerId, productId)`. Materialized **only for the products that customer has an authored price row for**. Cardinality: the number of contract rows a merchant actually wrote — not products × customers.

Per-customer prices MUST NOT enter the bucket key space. A sort or price-range facet over a catalogue too large to resolve in memory is a **merge** of a page from the bucket projection with that customer's overlay, not a scan of a per-customer index.

The projection itself is **not specified or built here**. This ADR fixes only its *shape*, because the bucket key is the single decision in it that cannot be retrofitted: every cache key, every context digest and every narrowing predicate written before it either admits this shape or forecloses it.

**Rationale.** This is the problem every platform in this space has already had, and the split above is where the ones that survived it landed. Sylius models the shared half as `ChannelPricing` and, when a search engine is added, normalizes it into the product document; the per-customer half it deliberately does *not* index, applying individual discounts in PHP after retrieval — which is why precise sorting by final price is not available there. Magento took the other road, `catalog_product_index_price` as a full `customer_group × website × product` cartesian, and its reindexing cost is the well-known consequence. The overlay is what lets this suite have Sylius's bounded index *and* correct sorting for contracted buyers: it is sparse by construction, because it materializes authored rows rather than a product space.

**Consequence.**
- `BuyerContext` carries `priceScopeKey` and `customerOverlayId` as separate named components (ADR-7, amended) — the projection is unbuildable without them.
- Price resolution exposes a SQL-shaped narrowing predicate alongside its in-memory matcher, under a soundness invariant (`pricing-engine.md` Phase 2). Without it the pre-projection read path loads every customer's contract rows to serve one buyer.
- The projection, when built, uses the existing `entity_indexes` / `query_index` machinery (generic JSONB projection rows, reindexer, jobs, coverage, queue) rather than a bespoke table — the suite does not own a second projection substrate.
- Until it exists, price sorting stays bounded and **visibly** degraded per `storefront-public-api.md` §6.3, never silently approximate for a buyer whose whole catalogue is negotiated.

**Rejected alternative.** One projection keyed on the full buyer-context digest. It is the simplest thing to write and it is the Magento outcome: every distinct buyer becomes a distinct key, the projection's size tracks customers rather than catalogue, and invalidating one price row touches an unbounded number of rows.

### 6.1 What each spec must contain beyond the standard checklist

| Spec | Non-obvious required content |
|---|---|
| 11 — Pricing engine | Owns the `PricingContext` **type shape** (`customerGroupIds`, `currencyCode`, the `globalThis` registry fix); spec 1 §3.2 owns the group **tie-break semantics** those ids resolve under. The split is stated in both documents |
| 12 — Buyer-scoped visibility | Amends specs 1, 3 and 5 rather than defining a module of its own; its amendments are **applied in those documents**, not left pending. Owns the multi-group union algebra (a disjunction of conjunctions, not a merged scope object) and the write-side enforcement `cart` otherwise lacked |
| 1 — Customer groups | Migration strategy for orphaned `customer_group_id` values; credit exposure calculation and its concurrency guarantee; approval policy model |
| 2 — Availability | Fallback semantics when `wms` is absent; caching and staleness budget; the oversell window and who owns it |
| 3 — `ecommerce` | Two-hop hostname resolution and its cache invalidation; `BuyerContext` resolver; branding SSR without FOUC |
| 4 — Public API | Buyer-context cache-key digest and private-response rules; facet cross-exclusion cost; rate limiting for unauthenticated traffic |
| 5 — Cart | Price snapshot staleness policy and re-pricing triggers; guest→customer merge conflict rules; optimistic locking; TTL and abandonment events; B2B quantity-break re-evaluation |
| 6 — Promotions | Realignment of the cart interaction API to the actual `cart` contract; code reservation under the cart's locking model |
| 7 — Checkout | Retirement path for `CheckoutCartItem`; cart lock/unlock protocol; quote-vs-order branch for B2B; purchase-on-account against credit limit; idempotency of submit |
| 8 — Merchandising | Boundary against `content` module pages; per-store vs. per-channel scoping; publishing and scheduling |
| 9 — Customer account | B2B buyer roster and approvals in the portal; order history sourced from `sales` without cross-module ORM relations |
| 10 — Storefront app | `@open-mercato/storefront-ui` budget and CI enforcement; WCAG 2.2 AA evidence; RWD; performance targets |

Specs 3, 6 and 7 are rewrites/amendments of existing documents. Per `.ai/specs/AGENTS.md`, their filenames are left unchanged — renaming legacy `SPEC-*` files is a separate, explicitly-requested normalization.

## 7) Phasing

Each phase is gated: the next does not start until the gate passes.

### Phase 0 — Foundations
Specs 1 and 2. Delivers `CustomerGroup` with membership and commercial terms, and the `availabilityService` contract with the `wms` implementation.

**Gate:** `catalog` price rows can be authored against a real group in admin UI and resolve correctly; `availabilityService` returns authoritative state with `wms` installed and a clean `not tracked` fallback without it.

### Phase 1 — Read side
Specs 3 and 4. Store, hostname binding, buyer-context resolver, branding, and the public catalog read API with facets and localization.

**Gate:** an anonymous request and an authenticated B2B request to the same product URL return correctly different prices, with no cross-tenant leakage and no cache bleed between buyer contexts.

### Phase 2 — Write side
Specs 5 and 6. Cart with line management, price snapshots, promotion effects and `salesCalculationService` totals.

**Gate:** cart totals are byte-identical to the totals of the `SalesOrder` the same cart produces; promotions apply identically on the product page and in the cart; a product outside the buyer's assortment is rejected by `cart.lines.add` as well as by the read API (spec 12 §6a).

### Phase 3 — Conversion
Spec 7. Checkout funnel: addresses, delivery selection with live rates, payment, order or quote creation, purchase-on-account.

**Gate:** end-to-end B2C purchase and B2B purchase-on-account both produce correct `SalesOrder` documents; submit is idempotent under retry and concurrent double-submit.

### Phase 4 — Experience
Specs 8, 9 and 10. Merchandising, customer account area, and the storefront application.

**Gate:** WCAG 2.2 AA audit passes; performance targets met; integration tests cover every API path and key UI path per `.ai/qa/AGENTS.md`.

### Cross-cutting — specs 11 and 12

Neither fits a single phase, because each amends work in several.

- **Spec 11 (pricing engine)** — Phase 1 (the `catalog` price-rule admin UI) is independently shippable at any time and has no suite dependency. Phase 2 (resolver-contract hardening: `customerGroupIds`, `currencyCode`, the `globalThis` registry fix) MUST land **before or with Phase 0's spec 1**, since spec 1 §7.1's consumer change depends on the widened `PricingContext`. Phase 3 (the optional `pricing` module) may land any time after Phase 2.
- **Spec 12 (buyer-scoped catalog visibility)** — its Phase 1 (the `packages/shared` visibility algebra and `customerGroupsService.resolveAssortmentScope()`) belongs with **Phase 0**, since spec 1 ships the group-terms column it operates on. Its Phase 2 belongs with **Phase 1** (`ecommerce` buyer-context composition), and its Phase 3 — the `cart` write-side enforcement — belongs with **Phase 2** and is the highest-priority of the three: without it, a product hidden from browsing is still purchasable through the cart API, so Phase 2's gate below does not pass without it.

## 8) Data Models

This umbrella defines no entities. It fixes ownership only:

| Concept | Owning module | Table prefix |
|---|---|---|
| Store, hostname binding, channel binding | `ecommerce` | `ecommerce_` |
| Cart, cart line | `cart` | `cart_` |
| Promotion, rule, benefit, code, usage | `promotions` | `promotion_` |
| Customer group, membership, commercial terms | `customer_groups` | `customer_group_` |
| Navigation, blocks, banners, curated sets | `merchandising` | `merchandising_` |
| Checkout session | `@open-mercato/checkout` | `checkout_` |

No entity may be introduced in a child spec under a prefix owned by another module.

---

## 9) API Contracts

This umbrella defines no endpoints. It fixes the namespaces:

| Namespace | Auth | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/ecommerce/storefront/*` | Public + optional buyer session | `ecommerce` |
| `/api/ecommerce/*` | `requireAuth`, `ecommerce.*` features | `ecommerce` |
| `/api/cart/*` | Public + optional buyer session, cart-token bound | `cart` |
| `/api/checkout/*` | Public + optional buyer session, session bound | `@open-mercato/checkout` |
| `/api/customer-groups/*` | `requireAuth` | `customer_groups` |
| `/api/merchandising/*` | Admin `requireAuth`; read mirror under storefront namespace | `merchandising` |

Every public namespace MUST be rate limited and MUST include the buyer-context digest in its cache key.

## 10) Risks & Impact Review

| # | Risk | Severity | Area | Failure scenario | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Buyer-context cache bleed | **Critical** | `ecommerce`, `cart` | A B2B contract price or restricted assortment is cached under a key omitting the buyer digest and served to an anonymous visitor or a different customer. Confidential pricing disclosed cross-tenant. | Cache key MUST include a digest of `BuyerContext`; authenticated responses marked `Cache-Control: private`; dedicated cross-context isolation tests are a Phase 1 gate criterion | Low — enforced by test, but a new cached endpoint could forget the digest; mitigated by a shared cache-key helper that takes `BuyerContext` as a required argument |
| R2 | Cart/order total divergence | **High** | `cart`, `sales` | Cart computes tax independently and shows 123,00 zł; the resulting invoice says 123,45 zł. Legal exposure under consumer pricing rules and Omnibus. | ADR-2 mandates `salesCalculationService`; Phase 2 gate requires byte-identical totals; property-based test over the tax matrix | Low |
| R3 | Orphaned `customer_group_id` values | Medium | `catalog`, `sales` | Existing price rows and tax rates reference group ids with no group. After `CustomerGroup` lands, those rows silently never match, changing effective prices. | No FK constraint in the first release; reconciliation report enumerating orphans; admin surfaces unknown-group rows as invalid rather than hiding them | Medium — depends on tenants acting on the report |
| R4 | Two checkout models diverge | **High** | `checkout`, `ecommerce` | SPEC-029 §19 is implemented by one team while Simple Checkout is implemented by another; two order-creation paths with different idempotency guarantees produce duplicate orders. | ADR-3 withdraws §19 explicitly; the SPEC-029 rewrite must state the withdrawal in its changelog | Low |
| R5 | Oversell between browse and submit | Medium | `availability`, `cart`, `wms` | Availability is read without reservation; two buyers check out the last unit concurrently. | Availability at browse time is advisory; the authoritative check plus reservation happens at checkout submit inside the order transaction; the child specs define the reservation window | Medium — inherent to non-reserving carts; accepted, and the oversell window must be documented, not hidden |
| R6 | Credit limit overshoot | **High** | `customer_groups`, `checkout` | Concurrent purchase-on-account orders each pass an optimistic credit check and jointly exceed the limit. | Credit exposure update inside a serializable transaction at submit, mirroring SPEC-055's budget-cap approach | Low |
| R7 | Suite scope exceeds delivery capacity | Medium | all | Twelve specs, seven new modules. Partial delivery leaves a storefront that browses but cannot sell. | Phase gating; Phases 0–3 are the minimum shippable set; Phase 4 spec 10 can slip without invalidating the API contract | Medium |
| R8 | `packages/core` bundle growth | Low | `core` | Six new modules in core means every tenant, including non-commerce ones, carries them. | Modules are opt-in via `modules.ts`; measure and report bundle delta at each phase gate | Low — revisit as a package split if the delta is material |

---

## 11) Open Questions

1. **Checkout step machine** — `workflows`-driven (configurable per store, supports B2B approval steps) or a fixed state machine (simpler, testable)? Decided in spec 7. *Leaning: `workflows`, because B2B approval and PO capture are per-tenant policy.*
2. **Guest B2B** — can an unauthenticated visitor purchase on account? *Assumed no; purchase-on-account requires an authenticated `CustomerUser` linked to a company.*
3. **Multi-store carts** — is a cart scoped to one store, or shared across stores in an organization? *Assumed scoped to one store; cross-store baskets have no stated requirement.*
4. **Assortment scoping source** — SPEC-029's `catalog_scope` JSONB on the channel binding, or group-based assortment rules in `customer_groups`? Both have B2B use. Decided in spec 3.
5. **`merchandising` vs `content`** — where does a category landing page with editorial copy live? Decided in spec 8.

## 12) Final Compliance Report

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| No cross-module ORM relations | Enforced by §4; every edge is FK id + DI service |
| Tenant/organization scoping | Every new entity carries `tenant_id` + `organization_id`; R1 covers the cache dimension |
| No new `SPEC-*` filename prefixes | New specs use `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{kebab-case}`; legacy names left unchanged per `.ai/specs/AGENTS.md` |
| Backward compatibility | ADR-6 adds no FK constraint in the first release; ADR-3 and ADR-5 withdraw unimplemented spec scope, not shipped contracts, so no deprecation protocol is triggered |
| Optimistic locking | Required on `Cart` (spec 5) and every user-editable new entity, per root `AGENTS.md` |
| Integration coverage | Each child spec must list coverage for all affected API paths and key UI paths, shipping in the same change |
| Instruction budget | This document lives in `.ai/specs/`, not `AGENTS.md`; no budget impact |

## 13) Changelog

### 2026-09-16
- **Added ADR-9** — buyer-scoped prices bucket by `priceScopeKey`, per-customer contracts are a sparse overlay, and the two never share a key space. Recorded now, ahead of the projection spec itself, because the bucket key is the one decision in that future work that cannot be retrofitted: `storefront-public-api.md` §6.3 already defers the projection to a separate spec, but nothing in the suite constrained its shape, so any cache key or digest written in the meantime could have foreclosed it.
- **Amended ADR-7** — `BuyerContext` now carries `assortmentScopeHash`, `priceScopeKey` and `customerOverlayId` as named, independently-hashable scope components, and the suite may no longer key a cache, projection or index on an opaque whole-context digest where a named component would do. `storefront-public-api.md` §9.1 had already been forced into this pattern once, reactively, to stop one buyer's price range leaking to another sharing an assortment scope; generalizing it is what makes ADR-9 expressible at all. Also fixed the ADR count in the TLDR (eight → nine).

### 2026-09-06
- Added specs 11 (`2026-08-21-pricing-engine.md`) and 12 (`2026-08-21-buyer-scoped-catalog-visibility.md`) to §3.1, §3.2, §6 and §7. Both were written after this document and both deviate from it materially — spec 11 introduces a new optional `pricing` module and changes a `catalog` contract; spec 12 introduces a new `packages/shared` contract and amends specs 1, 3 and 5 — so §1's rule that a deviating child spec "MUST amend this document first" applies to both, and neither had. An implementer using this roadmap as the suite's index would not have found the write-side visibility control spec 12 rates Critical.
- Added `packages/shared` to §3.2's extended-modules table: the suite now places two dependency-free contracts there (`lib/availability/`, `lib/catalog-visibility/`), which the ownership tables never acknowledged.
- Corrected the spec count: TLDR and Scope said "nine", §6's table listed ten and R7 said "Ten". Now twelve throughout, matching §6.
- ADR-4's contract shape updated to match the availability spec it governs (field rename, `isAuthoritative`) — see below.
- Phase 2's gate now includes the cart-side assortment check, which is what makes spec 12 Phase 3 a gating deliverable rather than a follow-up.

### 2026-08-14
- Initial umbrella specification.
- Recorded ADR-1 … ADR-8 following an architecture review of SPEC-029 against the implemented codebase.
- Findings driving the decisions: `CatalogProductPrice` already carries `customer_id`, `customer_group_id`, `user_id`, `user_group_id`, `channel_id`, quantity bounds and validity windows, and `catalog/lib/pricing.ts` already scores them by specificity — B2B pricing needs no new price model; `customer_group_id` has no owning table anywhere in the repo despite being consumed by `catalog` pricing/API/commands/AI tooling and `sales.SalesTaxRate`; `customer_accounts.DomainMapping` already implements domain verification and TLS lifecycle that SPEC-029 proposed to duplicate; `wms` already owns `InventoryBalance` and `InventoryReservation` with no availability contract exposed.
