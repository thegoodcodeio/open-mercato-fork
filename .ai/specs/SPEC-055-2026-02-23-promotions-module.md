# SPEC-055: Promotions Module

**Date**: 2026-02-23
**Status**: Approved (amended 2026-08-14, reconciliation-fixed 2026-08-17, audit-fixed 2026-08-17, applies-to/caps amendment 2026-09-07, §B.6 mapping corrected 2026-09-09 — see §Amendment)
**Suite**: [Ecommerce Suite Roadmap](./2026-08-14-ecommerce-suite-roadmap.md) — spec 6, Phase 2

> **Amendment notice (2026-08-14).** This spec was written against a hypothetical external cart addressed over HTTP by SKU. The platform now has a first-class [`cart` module](./2026-08-14-cart-module.md). The **Amendment** section near the end of this document is normative and takes precedence over the *Cart-Facing Endpoints* section where they conflict: the primary integration becomes a DI service call, the `/api/cart/*` namespace moves to `/api/promotions/*`, item addressing gains product and variant ids, and effects map onto `SalesAdjustmentDraft`. Everything else in this spec — the rule tree, the three-pass engine, codes, usage ledger, extensibility — is unchanged.

---

## TLDR

**Key Points:**
- A standalone `promotions` module that defines promotions via a flexible, recursive rule-condition tree, evaluates which promotions apply to a given cart context, and returns **fully resolved effects** to the cart module — promotions owns the math, the cart only applies the pre-computed results.
- Promotional codes (static vouchers and dynamically generated pools) are managed independently of individual promotions and linked via `CodeRule` nodes inside the rule tree.
- **Extensible by design**: other modules can register custom rule types, custom benefit types, evaluation middleware (before/after hooks), and custom admin configurator components — without modifying core promotions code.

**Scope:**
- Domain model: `Promotion`, `RuleGroup` (recursive tree), polymorphic `Rule` + 15 built-in rule types, polymorphic `Benefit` + 6 built-in benefit types with an explicit application target (`order`/`line`/`unit`) and cart-wide quantity caps, `Code`, `GeneratedCode`, `CodeReservation`, `CodeUsage`, `PromotionUsage` (per-order audit ledger + global spend tracking)
- Three-pass evaluation engine (boolean pass → benefit collection pass → effect resolution pass), product-page lightweight variant
- Promotion ordering, cumulativity, and tag-based self-exclusion algorithm
- Cart interaction REST API (apply-promotion, code lifecycle endpoints)
- Admin UI: drag-sortable promotion list, inline tree builder, promotional codes table
- Extension infrastructure: server-side `PromotionExtensionRegistry`, client-side configurator registry, evaluation middleware pipeline, declared widget injection slots

**Concerns:**
- Rule tree depth and polymorphic joins require careful N+1 mitigation and upfront caching strategy
- Code reservation TTL must be handled atomically; concurrent checkouts must not bypass per-customer limits
- Budget cap enforcement (`max_budget`) requires a serializable transaction in `registerUsage` to prevent concurrent checkouts from jointly overshooting the cap; the optimistic cache-based pre-check reduces but does not eliminate this race window

## Overview

The Promotions module is a first-class Open Mercato module that lives at `packages/core/src/modules/promotions/`. It enables operators to build complex promotional campaigns through a nested condition-benefit tree without writing code. The evaluation engine resolves applicable promotions and computes their fully resolved effects (actual amounts, free item SKUs, delivery discounts) at cart request time; the cart module receives pre-computed effects and applies them without re-doing any discount math.

> **Market Reference**: Studied Sylius (promotion + rule + action model), Magento 2 (cart price rules), and Akeneo (nested condition trees). Adopted Sylius's clean separation of rule evaluation from price application. Improved on it by making benefits first-class tree nodes (benefits on sub-groups, not just top-level promotions) and supporting a BuyXGetY and TieredDiscount native type that Sylius requires complex workarounds to achieve. Rejected Magento's flat rule model — it cannot express the conditional branching required by the spec. Rejected storing discount results in the promotions module — the cart module owns pricing; promotions is a pure resolver.

---

## Problem Statement

Open Mercato has no native promotions system. The POS module spec (SPEC-022) explicitly deferred promotions integration. Sales and catalog modules have no awareness of promotional discounts. Without this module:

- Operators cannot build rule-based campaigns (seasonal sales, loyalty tiers, code-gated offers, delivery discounts)
- The cart cannot apply promotions without a backend resolver
- Promotional codes cannot be managed or tracked

---

## Proposed Solution

A dedicated `promotions` module placed in `packages/core/src/modules/promotions/` following all platform conventions. It exposes:

1. **Admin UI** — promotion list with drag-sort, inline rule tree builder, code template manager
2. **Internal API** — standard CRUD for promotions, rule groups, and codes
3. **Cart API** — `/api/promotions/evaluate` and code lifecycle endpoints (`/api/promotions/codes/*`, `/api/promotions/usage/*`) consumed in-process by the `cart` module via `promotionsService`, or over HTTP by external carts/POS integrations (Amendment §A.2–A.3)
4. **Evaluation engine** — a two-pass recursive tree evaluator that is pure, stateless, and context-driven

### Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Benefits live on `RuleGroup`, not on `Promotion` | Allows different benefit sets for different condition branches within a single promotion |
| JSONB rule/benefit config | `promotion_rules` and `promotion_benefits` each store a `rule_type`/`benefit_type` discriminator and a `config jsonb` column. Follows the established `condition_expression` pattern in `business_rules` and `workflows`. Zod discriminated union validates config per type at the application boundary. No migrations required when adding new rule or benefit types. The only application-layer concern is validating `code_id` references inside `code` rule configs, handled in commands before persisting. |
| Codes are promotion-agnostic | A single code template can unlock multiple promotions simultaneously via `CodeRule` in each promotion's tree |
| Three-pass evaluation | Pass 1 is pure boolean (no side effects); Pass 2 collects benefits only from fully-satisfied ancestor chains; Pass 3 resolves each benefit into concrete effects using the cart context (actual amounts, free item SKUs) — avoids partial benefit collection and keeps math out of the cart |
| Promotions resolves effects; cart applies them | The promotions engine owns all discount math — it receives unit prices in the cart context and returns fully computed effect amounts. The cart module applies pre-computed effects without re-doing any calculations. No duplication, no ambiguity, deterministic totals. |
| Free item effects include the SKU and quantity | `ADD_FREE_ITEM` effects carry the resolved SKU and quantity — the cart does not decide which item to add; the promotions engine resolves BuyXGetY and FreeProduct benefit configs into the correct item reference |
| Dynamic code generation via background worker | Generating thousands of unique codes is CPU-bound; must not block request threads |
| CodeReservation with 24h TTL | Soft hold to prevent concurrent multi-session exploitation; a completed checkout produces a permanent `CodeUsage` record |

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Why Rejected |
|-------------|-------------|
| Store promotions in sales module | Promotions are cross-cutting (POS, e-commerce, B2B); sales module is document-flow oriented |
| Flat rule model (Magento-style) | Cannot express conditional sub-group branching with per-branch benefits |
| Return benefit descriptors and let cart compute math | Duplicates discount logic in every cart integration; changes to discount formulas must be coordinated across modules; creates ambiguity on tiered/BuyXGetY math |

## User Stories / Use Cases

- **Operator** wants to create a seasonal sale that gives 20% off all electronics so that customers get an automatic discount at checkout
- **Operator** wants to configure a Buy 2 Get 1 Free rule so that the system automatically grants the free product when the cart qualifies
- **Operator** wants to issue a one-time-use voucher code for newsletter subscribers so that only targeted recipients get the discount
- **Operator** wants to build a tiered loyalty discount (spend €100 = 5%, €200 = 10%) so that higher spenders are rewarded automatically
- **Operator** wants to offer free shipping on orders over €50 for a specific delivery method so that the discount is scoped correctly
- **Operator** wants to exclude pharmaceutical products from all promotions so that regulatory-controlled items are never discounted
- **Cashier / Cart** wants to submit a cart context and receive a list of applicable benefits so that price calculations can be performed in the cart module
- **Customer** wants to enter a promotional code so that their qualifying discount is applied to their cart
- **Operator** wants to reorder promotions by drag-and-drop so that evaluation priority is immediately obvious and controllable
- **Operator** wants to cap a discount at the first 5 pieces so that a promotion on a bulk-ordered product cannot drain the margin on a large cart (**US-J**)
- **Operator** wants to state whether a benefit applies to the whole order, to a line, or to each piece so that the same "20% off" does not silently mean three different things (**US-K**)

### Evaluation Engine Data Flow

```
POST /api/promotions/evaluate  (or promotionsService.evaluate() in-process — Amendment §A.2)
  │
  ├─ Load active promotions (from cache, key: promotions:active:{tenantId}:{organizationId})
  │   └─ Serves NormalizedPromotion[] — no ORM entities, zero DB access during evaluation
  │
  ├─ For each promotion (ORDER BY order ASC, id ASC):
  │   ├─ Check excluded_tags ∩ applied_tags → skip if non-empty
  │   ├─ Currency eligibility check: if promotion.eligibleCurrencies.length > 0
  │   │   AND context.currency ∉ promotion.eligibleCurrencies → skip
  │   ├─ Budget pre-check (optimistic): if promotion.maxBudget is set
  │   │   AND promotion.totalDiscountGranted >= promotion.maxBudget → skip
  │   │   (Not authoritative — enforced atomically in registerUsage)
  │   ├─ Apply item exclusion filters (exclude_medicine, etc.)
  │   ├─ Pass 1: evaluateGroup(rootGroup, context) → boolean
  │   └─ If true:
  │       ├─ Pass 2: collectBenefits(rootGroup, parentChainValid=true) → NormalizedBenefit[]
  │       ├─ Pass 3: resolveEffects(benefits, context) → ResolvedEffect[]
  │       │   ├─ Each benefit config + cart context → concrete amounts (LINE_DISCOUNT,
  │       │   │  CART_DISCOUNT, DELIVERY_DISCOUNT, ADD_FREE_ITEM). Math lives here only.
  │       │   └─ Per benefit with a quantity cap: selectUnits(benefit, context) orders
  │       │      qualifying units/lines by `selector`, then spends a cart-wide budget of
  │       │      `max_quantity` units and `max_lines` lines across them, in blocks of
  │       │      `quantity_step`. The budget is per benefit invocation and spans lines,
  │       │      so it is held here — not inside a per-line loop.
  │       ├─ applied_tags ← applied_tags ∪ promotion.tags
  │       └─ If !promotion.cumulative → BREAK
  │
  └─ Return: { appliedPromotions: AppliedPromotion[] }
             where AppliedPromotion = { promotionId, promotionName, effects: ResolvedEffect[] }
```

### Normalized Promotion Shape

The active promotions cache stores `NormalizedPromotion` plain objects — never ORM entity graphs. This structure is fully eager-loaded, denormalized, and immutable. It is the only input the evaluation engine may receive.

```
NormalizedPromotion {
  id: uuid
  name: string
  order: number
  cumulative: boolean
  tags: string[]
  excludedTags: string[]
  excludeFlags: Record<string, boolean>
  eligibleCurrencies: string[]        // empty array = all currencies
  maxBudget: string | null            // null = no cap; decimal string in budgetCurrency
  budgetCurrency: string | null       // ISO 4217; null when maxBudget is null
  totalDiscountGranted: string        // snapshot at cache-build time; used for optimistic budget pre-check only
  rootGroup: NormalizedRuleGroup
}

NormalizedRuleGroup {
  operator: "and" | "or"
  rules: NormalizedRule[]        // pre-sorted by sort_order
  benefits: NormalizedBenefit[]  // pre-sorted by sort_order
  children: NormalizedRuleGroup[]
}

NormalizedRule {
  type: string
  config: Record<string, unknown>
}

NormalizedBenefit {
  type: string
  appliesTo: "order" | "line" | "unit"
  config: Record<string, unknown>
}
```

**Normalization requirements:**

- Polymorphic tables are flattened — each `(dispatcher, concrete)` row becomes a single `{ type, config }` object
- ORM references are not retained in the normalized structure
- Arrays are pre-sorted by `sort_order`
- In non-production builds, objects are deep-frozen to detect accidental mutation

### Cache Build Contract

`services/promotion-cache.ts` guarantees:

1. A single cache build performs **all** required database reads (promotions → rule groups (recursive) → `promotion_rules` → `promotion_benefits` → `SUM(total_discount_amount)` per promotion from `promotion_usages WHERE reverted_at IS NULL`)
2. After caching, promotion evaluation executes with **zero database access**
3. Any missing eager-loaded relation is treated as a critical bug
4. `totalDiscountGranted` in `NormalizedPromotion` is a **snapshot** — it is intentionally stale between cache rebuilds. It is used only for an optimistic pre-check that skips obviously-exhausted promotions without adding latency. Authoritative enforcement happens in `registerUsage` inside a serializable transaction.

The evaluation engine (`lib/evaluation-engine.ts`) operates purely on `NormalizedPromotion` objects and **must not** use the entity manager, repository calls, lazy relation access, or dynamic DB lookups. All required data must be provided via the cart context or the normalized promotion.

### Code Lifecycle

```
codes/reserve  → validate code + per-customer limit → create CodeReservation (TTL 24h)
codes/validate → re-check reservation + code active status
evaluate       → code_id passed in context → CodeRule evaluator matches
codes/use      → deactivate GeneratedCode OR increment Code.used → write CodeUsage → delete reservation
codes/release  → delete CodeReservation only
```

(route names per `/api/promotions/*`, Amendment §A.3 — each also has a matching `promotionsService` method, §A.2)

### Promotion Usage Lifecycle

```
usage/register → validate orderId not already registered (idempotent upsert)
              → open serializable transaction
              → re-read SUM(total_discount_amount) WHERE reverted_at IS NULL AND currency = budget_currency
              → if max_budget set AND new total would exceed max_budget → rollback, emit budget-exhausted, return 422
              → write PromotionUsage (effects_snapshot, total_discount_amount, currency, order_type)
              → commit → emit promotions.usage.registered → invalidate promotion cache entry
usage/revert  → SET reverted_at = NOW() on all PromotionUsage rows
              WHERE order_id = ? AND organization_id = ? AND tenant_id = ? AND reverted_at IS NULL
              → emit promotions.usage.reverted → invalidate promotion cache entry
```

`PromotionUsageService` (`lib/promotion-usage-service.ts`) exposes:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `registerUsage(params)` | Writes `PromotionUsage`; enforces `max_budget` atomically inside a serializable transaction; idempotent on `(promotion_id, order_id, tenant_id)` |
| `revertUsage(orderId, organizationId, tenantId)` | Marks all matching usage rows reverted; never deletes rows (audit immutability) |
| `getBudgetConsumed(promotionId, organizationId, tenantId, currency)` | `SUM(total_discount_amount) WHERE reverted_at IS NULL AND currency = ?`; used by `registerUsage` inside the transaction |

`registerUsage` **does not validate or re-evaluate** the promotion — it records the effects already returned by `apply-promotion`. The caller (cart/POS integration) is responsible for passing the correct `ResolvedEffect[]` snapshot.

The `promotions.usage.registered` and `promotions.usage.reverted` events trigger cache invalidation so that `totalDiscountGranted` in `NormalizedPromotion` stays approximately current.

### Commands & Events

| Command | Event emitted |
|---------|--------------|
| `promotions.promotion.create` | `promotions.promotion.created` |
| `promotions.promotion.update` | `promotions.promotion.updated` |
| `promotions.promotion.delete` | `promotions.promotion.deleted` |
| `promotions.code.create` | `promotions.code.created` |
| `promotions.code.update` | `promotions.code.updated` |
| `promotions.code.delete` | `promotions.code.deleted` |
| `promotions.code.use` | `promotions.code.used` |
| `promotions.generated-code.generate` | `promotions.generated-code.created` (batch) |

Additional events emitted by the evaluation and code pipelines:

| Trigger | Event emitted | Payload |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Successful `apply-promotion` call | `promotions.evaluation.completed` | `{ organizationId, tenantId, appliedPromotionIds, effectCount, durationMs }` |
| `use-code` finalises successfully | `promotions.code.used` (existing) + `promotions.code.exhausted` (if the code pool is now empty) | |
| Code pool drops to zero available | `promotions.code.exhausted` | `{ organizationId, tenantId, codeId, codeName }` |
| Promotion `ends_at` within 48h | `promotions.promotion.expiring-soon` | `{ organizationId, tenantId, promotionId, endsAt }` — emitted by a scheduled check, not on mutation |
| `register-usage` commits successfully | `promotions.usage.registered` | `{ organizationId, tenantId, promotionId, orderId, orderType, totalDiscountAmount, currency }` |
| `revert-usage` marks rows reverted | `promotions.usage.reverted` | `{ organizationId, tenantId, orderId, promotionIds: string[] }` |
| `max_budget` first reached via `registerUsage` | `promotions.promotion.budget-exhausted` | `{ organizationId, tenantId, promotionId, maxBudget, totalDiscountGranted, budgetCurrency }` |

### Evaluation Middleware Hooks

These are synchronous hooks registered on `PromotionExtensionRegistry` — they are NOT async event bus events. They execute in-process within the same request and are called in registration order.

| Hook | When it runs | What it can do |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `EvaluationMiddleware.beforeEvaluate` | Before Pass 1 starts for any promotion | Return a modified `CartContext` (e.g. append loyalty tier data to `context.extensions`) |
| `EvaluationMiddleware.afterResolve` | After Pass 3 produces all `AppliedPromotion[]` | Filter, augment, or reorder the resolved effects (e.g. enterprise pricing caps a maximum discount) |
| `CodeMiddleware.beforeCodeUse` | Inside the serializable transaction before `use-code` commits | Throw a typed error to veto code use |
| `CodeMiddleware.afterCodeUse` | After `use-code` transaction commits (outside transaction) | Side effects — awarding loyalty points, sending confirmation events |

Middleware is registered at DI startup and is immutable for the lifetime of the process. Registration order is deterministic (alphabetical by module ID within a single DI container boot).

### Benefit

Table: `promotion_benefits`

|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | uuid PK | |

| `promotion_id` | uuid FK → promotions | Denormalised |
| `benefit_type` | text | Discriminator |
| `applies_to` | text | `order` \| `line` \| `unit` — the application target (see below). NOT NULL; the write path fills it from the benefit type's default when the operator does not choose one. |

#### Application target (`applies_to`)

Every benefit states what it is applied to. Before this field existed the target was implied by `benefit_type` and written down nowhere, which made "10% off, but only the first 5 pieces" inexpressible and left `cart` guessing how to map a resolved effect.

`applies_to` is a **column, not a config field.** It decides the shape of the resolved effect and therefore how `cart` hands that effect to `salesCalculationService`; core must be able to read it for a benefit whose `config` schema core does not own (extension benefit types — see §Extensibility). A discriminator-independent value inside a discriminated union is also the one thing a Zod discriminated union models badly.

| Value | Meaning | Resolved effect |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `order` | One effect against the document as a whole. Not attributable to any single line. | `CART_DISCOUNT`, `DELIVERY_DISCOUNT`, or `ADD_FREE_ITEM` |
| `line` | Qualifying **lines** are discounted whole. Quantity caps consume entire lines: a line is either fully covered or not covered at all. | `LINE_DISCOUNT` with `appliedQuantity` equal to the line's full quantity |
| `unit` | Qualifying **units** are discounted individually. Quantity caps consume units, so a line may be partially covered. | `LINE_DISCOUNT` with `appliedQuantity` ≤ the line's quantity |

`ADD_FREE_ITEM` sits at `order` because a promotion-inserted line is not a discount *on* anything in the cart — it is a new line the promotion decided to add. `buy_x_get_y` is the one type that can emit either shape: a percentage or fixed reward discounts the reward line (`LINE_DISCOUNT`, hence its `line`/`unit` targets), while a 100%-off reward is emitted as `ADD_FREE_ITEM` regardless of the benefit's `applies_to`, because there is no existing line to attribute it to.

`line` and `unit` produce the same effect *type*; they differ in whether a cap is allowed to split a line. That difference is the whole point: "20% off, max 5 pieces" on a cart holding one line of 8 means 5 discounted units under `unit`, and nothing at all under `line` (8 > 5, and a line cannot be split).

**Allowed values per benefit type** — enforced in `data/validators.ts`, not merely documented:

| `benefit_type` | Allowed `applies_to` | Default |
|----------------|----------------------|---------|
| `product_discount` | `line`, `unit` | `line` |
| `cart_discount` | `order` | `order` |
| `delivery_discount` | `order` | `order` |
| `free_product` | `order` | `order` |
| `buy_x_get_y` | `line`, `unit` | `unit` |
| `tiered_discount` | `order`, `line`, `unit` | `order` |

`tiered_discount` previously carried its own `scope` (`cart`\|`line`) and `delivery_discount` an undocumented `scope text` whose value set appeared nowhere in this document. Both are removed in favour of `applies_to`; `scope: 'cart'` reads as `applies_to: 'order'`.

#### Quantity caps (shared config block)

These three fields are validated by one shared Zod object intersected into every built-in benefit variant, so the same words mean the same thing on every benefit type. `product_discount`'s `pcs_limit` — one undefined sentence, and absent from `tiered_discount` — is replaced by `max_quantity`.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `max_quantity` | int nullable | Maximum number of **units** the benefit may discount. Null = unbounded. Only meaningful when `applies_to` is `line` or `unit`. |
| `max_lines` | int nullable | Maximum number of **lines** the benefit may touch. Null = unbounded. Only meaningful when `applies_to` is `line` or `unit`. |
| `quantity_step` | int nullable | Units are consumed in whole blocks of this size; a remainder smaller than one block is not discounted. Null = 1. Expresses "discount applies per pair", the counterpart of Magento's `discount_step`. Defined in units only — rejected 422 under `applies_to: 'line'`, where the budget spends whole lines and a "block of units" has no meaning. |
| `selector` | text nullable | Which qualifying units the budget is spent on (values below). Required when `max_quantity` or `max_lines` is set; on an uncapped benefit `null` is read as `all`. |
| `nth_position` | int nullable | Position for `selector: nth`, 1-indexed. Required with `nth`, rejected without it. |

`selector` and `nth_position` live in this shared block rather than on individual benefit configs — `nth` was previously offered to three benefit types while only `product_discount` carried a field to hold its position, so it was unusable on the other two.

**Counting basis — normative.** `max_quantity` and `max_lines` are counted **across the whole cart, per benefit invocation** — not per line, and not per satisfied rule. A cart holding three lines of the same product at four pieces each, against a benefit with `max_quantity: 5`, yields five discounted units in total (four on the first line, one on the second, none on the third under `applies_to: 'unit'`; four on the first line and nothing more under `applies_to: 'line'`, because covering a second whole line would need eight). Per-line counting was rejected because a buyer defeats it by splitting a purchase across lines — and with configurable products (engraving, B2B configurator output) the lines split on their own, so the cap would loosen for reasons unrelated to intent.

**Cap ordering — normative.** `selector` (below) decides which units the budget is spent on, and it is **required whenever `max_quantity` or `max_lines` is set**; a config that caps without selecting is a 422 at the write path. There is deliberately no default: "the first 5 pieces" and "the 5 most expensive pieces" are different promotions with different costs, and silently picking one for the operator is how a campaign overspends. Within the chosen order, ties break on `cartLineId` ascending so evaluation is deterministic across retries.

**Three orthogonal caps.** `max_quantity` bounds *how many units*, `max_discount` bounds *how much money* (§below), and `buy_x_get_y.max_applications` bounds *how many times the trigger fires*. They compose; whichever binds first wins, and a benefit may set all three. The two counters run over different things — `max_applications` counts trigger firings, each consuming `trigger_quantity` units, while `max_quantity` counts *rewarded* units — so one rule settles the overlap: **an application whose reward the remaining `max_quantity` budget cannot fund in full is not granted at all.** A partially funded final application is dropped rather than pro-rated, because a half-delivered "buy 2 get 1 free" is a support ticket.

**Write-path rejections (422), normative.** The shared block is intersected into every benefit variant for schema uniformity, but a quantity cap on a target that has no quantity is an operator error, not a field to ignore:

| Rejected configuration | Why |
|---|---|
| `max_quantity`, `max_lines` or `quantity_step` set on a benefit whose `applies_to` is `order` | Nothing to count; silently ignoring it would make the admin UI show a cap that does not apply |
| `max_quantity` or `max_lines` set with no `selector` | §B.4 — the operator has not said which units the budget buys |
| `selector: all` combined with any quantity cap | A contradiction: `all` means every qualifying unit |
| `selector: nth` combined with `max_quantity` **or** `max_lines` | `nth` selects exactly one unit and is its own cap |
| `selector: nth` without `nth_position`, or `nth_position` without `selector: nth` | Neither half is meaningful alone |
| `quantity_step` set with `applies_to: 'line'` | Blocks are counted in units; the `line` target spends whole lines |

**Config schemas per `benefit_type`:**

Every variant below is intersected with the shared quantity-cap block (`max_quantity`, `max_lines`, `quantity_step`, `selector`, `nth_position`) described above; the fields listed here are the type-specific ones.

| `benefit_type` | Config fields |
|----------------|---------------|
| `product_discount` | `sku` text nullable, `discount_type` text, `value` decimal string, `limit_to_category` text nullable, `excluded_producers` text[], `max_discount` decimal string nullable, `labels` Record\<locale, string\> |
| `cart_discount` | `discount_type` text, `value` decimal string, `max_discount` decimal string nullable, `labels` Record\<locale, string\> |
| `delivery_discount` | `delivery_method_code` text, `discount_type` text, `value` decimal string, `labels` Record\<locale, string\> |
| `free_product` | `sku` text nullable, `category_slug` text nullable, `quantity` int, `labels` Record\<locale, string\> |
| `buy_x_get_y` | `trigger_sku` text nullable, `trigger_category_slug` text nullable, `trigger_quantity` int, `reward_sku` text, `reward_quantity` int, `discount_type` text, `value` decimal string, `max_applications` int nullable, `max_discount` decimal string nullable, `labels` Record\<locale, string\> |
| `tiered_discount` | `limit_to_category` text nullable, `tiers` TierElement[], `max_discount` decimal string nullable, `labels` Record\<locale, string\> |

**`selector` values** — which qualifying units a capped benefit spends its budget on. Lives in the shared block above, so every benefit type targeting `line` or `unit` has it; **required whenever `max_quantity` or `max_lines` is set**, and read as `all` when a benefit sets no cap.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `all` | Every qualifying unit receives the benefit. Only valid with no quantity cap — `all` plus a cap is a contradiction and is rejected at the write path. |
| `cart_order` | Units in cart order — the order lines were added to the cart, then unit index within a line. This is the value that means "the **first** N pieces". |
| `cheapest` | Lowest unit price first |
| `most_expensive` | Highest unit price first |
| `nth` | Only the item at position `nth_position` (1-indexed) in ascending price order — the *n*-th unit under `applies_to: 'unit'`, the *n*-th line under `applies_to: 'line'`, following the same ordering rule as every other selector. Its own cap, so it may not be combined with `max_quantity` or `max_lines`. |

Under `applies_to: 'line'` the selector orders **lines** by the unit price of the line; under `applies_to: 'unit'` it orders **units**. Ties break on `cartLineId` ascending, then unit index, so a re-evaluation of an unchanged cart returns identical effects.

`max_discount` (optional, decimal string) caps the total monetary discount produced by a single benefit invocation. The effect resolver in `lib/effect-resolvers.ts` applies the cap after computing the raw amount: `effectiveAmount = min(rawAmount, max_discount)`. The cap is expressed in the cart's operating currency. This allows operators to configure benefits such as "10% off the cart, but no more than $1000". Applies to `product_discount`, `cart_discount`, `buy_x_get_y`, and `tiered_discount`; not relevant for `delivery_discount` (naturally bounded by delivery cost) or `free_product`/`buy_x_get_y` free-item additions (no monetary amount computed).

**`tiers` schema** for `tiered_discount` config must be explicitly validated in `data/validators.ts`. Each tier element: `{ threshold: string (decimal), discount_type: "percentage" | "fixed", value: string (decimal) }`. Tiers must be sorted ascending by `threshold`; the evaluator applies the highest tier whose threshold is met.

### GeneratedCode

Table: `promotion_generated_codes`

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | uuid PK | |
| `code_id` | uuid FK → promotion_codes | |
| `organization_id` | uuid | |
| `tenant_id` | uuid | |
| `code` | text UNIQUE (per tenant) | Actual voucher string |

### CodeReservation

Table: `promotion_code_reservations`

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | uuid PK | |
| `code_id` | uuid | FK to `promotion_codes` |
| `code_string` | text | Resolved code (for display) |
| `customer_id` | text | Customer session identifier |
| `organization_id` | uuid | |
| `tenant_id` | uuid | |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | |
| `expires_at` | timestamptz | `created_at + 24h` |

> **Unique constraint**: `UNIQUE (code_id, customer_id)` — enforces at most one reservation row per customer per code. The application uses **upsert semantics**: on re-reservation, the existing row's `expires_at` is extended rather than inserting a new row. To check if a reservation is still active, compare `expires_at > NOW()` in application logic or queries — not in the index. This sidesteps PostgreSQL's prohibition on volatile functions (`NOW()`) in index predicates.

### CodeUsage

Table: `promotion_code_usages`

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | uuid PK | |

| `customer_id` | text | |
| `organization_id` | uuid | |
| `tenant_id` | uuid | |
| `used_at` | timestamptz | |

### PromotionUsage

Table: `promotion_usages`

Serves a dual purpose: **compliance audit ledger** (immutable record of exactly what discounts were applied to each order/quote) and **global usage counter** (drives `max_budget` enforcement and `revertUsage` on cancellation).

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | uuid PK | |
| `organization_id` | uuid | |
| `tenant_id` | uuid | |
| `promotion_id` | uuid FK → promotions | |
| `order_id` | text | External order/quote/cart ID supplied by the caller |
| `order_type` | text | `order`, `quote`, `pos_cart` — for cross-document audit filtering |
| `customer_id` | text nullable | Customer session identifier |
| `currency` | text | ISO 4217 currency code the order was placed in |
| `total_discount_amount` | numeric | Sum of all `|amount|` values from `ResolvedEffect[]` for this promotion on this order |
| `effects_snapshot` | jsonb | Full `ResolvedEffect[]` snapshot at time of registration — immutable audit record |
| `registered_at` | timestamptz | When the usage was recorded |
| `reverted_at` | timestamptz nullable | Set on order cancellation; row is never deleted — reverted rows are excluded from budget aggregation |

**Unique constraint**: `UNIQUE (promotion_id, order_id, organization_id, tenant_id)` — prevents double-registration for the same order. `registerUsage` uses upsert semantics (idempotent on re-submission).

**Index**: `(promotion_id, organization_id, tenant_id, currency, reverted_at)` — supports efficient `SUM(total_discount_amount) WHERE reverted_at IS NULL AND currency = ?` for budget checks.

**Resolved Effect Types:**

| Type | Required fields | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| `LINE_DISCOUNT` | `targetSku`, `targetCartLineId`, `appliesTo`, `lineQuantity`, `appliedQuantity`, `unitAmount`, `amount` (negative string), `basis`, `currency` | One effect per affected line item. `amount` is the total row discount; `appliedQuantity` states how many of the line's `lineQuantity` units it covers, and `unitAmount` the per-unit share. A capped benefit reports `appliedQuantity < lineQuantity` — see §Amendment B for why the consumer must not recompute `amount` from `unitAmount × lineQuantity`. |
| `CART_DISCOUNT` | `appliesTo`, `amount` (negative string), `basis`, `currency` | Flat or percentage discount applied against cart subtotal |
| `DELIVERY_DISCOUNT` | `appliesTo`, `deliveryMethodCode`, `amount` (negative string), `basis`, `currency` | Amount is the discount against delivery cost; may reduce to zero. For `percentage` discount types, the effect resolver computes the concrete amount using `deliveryCost` from the cart context — `deliveryCost` must be present in the request when a delivery method is selected. |
| `ADD_FREE_ITEM` | `sku`, `quantity`, `reason` | Promotions resolves which SKU and how many; cart adds the line. `reason` is `FREE_PRODUCT` or `BUY_X_GET_Y` |

**Invariants:**
- `amount` is always a negative decimal string (the cart adds it; no sign confusion)
- **Every** effect carrying an amount also carries `appliesTo` and `basis` — §A.5 made `basis` required on all of them and A-R1 (rated High) depends on it, so a `CART_DISCOUNT` or `DELIVERY_DISCOUNT` without it is malformed, not merely undocumented
- One `LINE_DISCOUNT` effect per **cart line** per promotion (Amendment §A.4 replaced SKU targeting with `targetCartLineId` precisely because two lines may share a SKU with different `configuration` — `TC-PROM-054` asserts they receive independent discounts). Effects for the same line from different promotions are separate entries in separate `appliedPromotions` objects. A partially covered line stays **one** effect carrying `appliedQuantity` — the engine never emits one effect per unit, so a 50-unit line cannot fan out into 50 effects
- `amount === unitAmount × appliedQuantity`, rounded once, to the currency's minor unit. `appliedQuantity ≥ 1` and `appliedQuantity ≤ lineQuantity`; an effect covering zero units is omitted, never returned with `amount: "0"`
- The identity holds **after** `max_discount` capping, not before. The resolver computes the raw amount, applies the cap to `amount`, then **back-solves** `unitAmount = amount / appliedQuantity` — it never reports a pre-cap `unitAmount` beside a post-cap `amount`. `appliedQuantity` is not reduced to absorb the cap: the promotion still covered those units, it simply paid less per unit
- `appliedQuantity === lineQuantity` whenever `appliesTo` is `line`; only `appliesTo: 'unit'` may report partial coverage
- `ADD_FREE_ITEM` effects are decided entirely by the promotions engine — the cart must not compute which free item to add from raw benefit config
- When `max_discount` is set on a benefit config, the effect resolver caps `|amount|` at `max_discount` before returning the effect — the resolved `amount` is always `≥ -max_discount`. The cap is applied per-benefit, not across the whole promotion.

Side effects: runs inside a **serializable transaction** that re-checks global usage limits, per-customer limits, and code active status before proceeding (closes multi-device race conditions). Deactivates `GeneratedCode` (dynamic) OR increments `Code.used` + deactivates if exhausted (static). Writes `CodeUsage`. Deletes `CodeReservation`.

#### `POST /api/promotions/codes/release` (was `/api/cart/delete-code` — see Amendment §A.3)

Request: `{ organizationId, tenantId, codeString, customerId }`
Response: `{ ok: true }` — deletes `CodeReservation` only.

#### `POST /api/promotions/usage/register` (was `/api/cart/register-usage` — see Amendment §A.3)

Called by the cart integration after an order/quote is **confirmed** (payment captured or quote finalised). Records the discount audit trail and enforces the lifetime budget cap.

Request:
```jsonc
{
  "organizationId": "uuid",
  "tenantId": "uuid",
  "orderId": "string",
  "orderType": "order | quote | pos_cart",
  "customerId": "string | null",
  "currency": "USD",
  "appliedPromotions": [
    {
      "promotionId": "uuid",
      "effects": [/* ResolvedEffect[] — same shape as returned by apply-promotion */]
    }
  ]
}
```

Response: `{ ok: true }` — 200. Idempotent on re-submission for the same `orderId`.

Side effects: for each `appliedPromotion`, runs `PromotionUsageService.registerUsage(...)` inside a serializable transaction that re-checks `max_budget`. If any promotion's budget would be exceeded, that promotion's write is rolled back and the endpoint returns **207 Multi-Status** with a `budgetExceeded` flag for the affected promotion IDs — the caller should re-evaluate whether to proceed with the order at a reduced discount or notify the customer. Emits `promotions.usage.registered` per successful promotion. Emits `promotions.promotion.budget-exhausted` when the running total first reaches `max_budget`.

#### `POST /api/promotions/usage/revert` (was `/api/cart/revert-usage` — see Amendment §A.3)

Called by the cart integration when an order is **cancelled** or a quote is **rejected/expired**.

Request: `{ organizationId, tenantId, orderId }`
Response: `{ ok: true, revertedCount: number }` — `revertedCount` is the number of `PromotionUsage` rows marked reverted.

Side effects: calls `PromotionUsageService.revertUsage(...)`. Rows are never deleted — `reverted_at` is set. Emits `promotions.usage.reverted`. Invalidates the promotion cache so `totalDiscountGranted` is refreshed.

#### `GET /api/dynamic-labels`

Response: list of promotion condition summaries for storefront label rendering (promotion name, active rules in simplified form, applicable products/categories).

#### `POST /api/free-products`

Request: cart context subset. Response: free product offers (FreeProductBenefit + BuyXGetY) applicable to the given context.

#### `POST /api/delivery-methods`

Request: cart context + delivery method codes to check. Response: which delivery methods have active discount benefits.

#### `POST /api/product-page`

Request: `{ organizationId, tenantId, skus: string[] }` — list of SKUs rendered on a product listing or detail page.
Response: `{ badges: Array<{ sku: string, promotionId: uuid, promotionName: string, label: Record<string, string> }> }` — one entry per SKU that has an active promotion with a matching `ProductDiscount` or `BuyXGetY` benefit. Evaluated via `lib/product-page-engine.ts` against the same normalized promotion cache; zero DB access.

#### `GET /api/promotions/extension-types`

Returns all rule and benefit extensions currently registered in `PromotionExtensionRegistry`. Used by the admin tree builder to populate rule/benefit type dropdowns with extension entries.

Requires `requireAuth` + `promotions.view` feature.

Response:
```jsonc
{
  "ruleTypes": [
    {
      "type": "loyalty.tier_membership",
      "label": { "en": "Customer loyalty tier", "pl": "Poziom lojalności klienta" },
      "description": { "en": "Applies when the customer belongs to the specified loyalty tier" },
      "contextKeys": ["loyalty.tier_membership"]
    }
  ],
  "benefitTypes": [
    {
      "type": "loyalty.points_multiplier",
      "label": { "en": "Loyalty points multiplier", "pl": "Mnożnik punktów lojalnościowych" },
      "description": { "en": "Multiplies earned loyalty points for this cart" },
      "contextKeys": [],
      "supportedAppliesTo": ["order"],
      "defaultAppliesTo": "order",
      "capsHonoured": false
    }
  ]
}
```

`contextKeys` is surfaced so cart integrations can determine which `extensions` fields to include in `POST /api/promotions/evaluate` requests (or the `evaluate()` DI call, in-process — Amendment §A.2).

`supportedAppliesTo` / `defaultAppliesTo` let the tree builder restrict the **Applies to** control for an extension benefit exactly as it does for a built-in one, and `capsHonoured: false` makes the admin UI disable the quantity-cap fields with an explanation instead of offering a cap the extension will ignore.

---

## Internationalization (i18n)

- All admin UI labels, tooltips, empty states, confirmation dialogs, error messages in locale files
- Benefit `labels` field is a per-locale map stored in JSONB; rendered by cart/checkout/POS
- `translations.ts` declares benefit label fields as translatable for the platform's translation system
- Key namespaces: `promotions.*`, `promotions.codes.*`, `promotions.rules.*`, `promotions.benefits.*`

---

## UI/UX

### Promotions List (`/backend/promotions`)

- Server-side paginated list (default page size 50, max 100); server-side filter bar: name search, date range, active state, cumulative state, tag filter
- Card layout: header (drag handle + name + date badges + tag chips), footer (Active toggle, Cumulative toggle, Edit, Delete)
- Drag-and-drop reorder via dnd-kit operates on the current filtered/paginated set; keyboard Up/Down arrow buttons as accessible alternative
- Pending changes (order or toggle) highlighted — Save button shows accent border; changes not persisted until explicit Save
- Warning banner when saving with active filter: *"Saving while filtered may reorder promotions outside the current page"*
- Delete: confirm dialog if promotion has a non-empty rule tree

### Promotion Form (`/backend/promotions/[id]`)

Four panels in a single page (not tabs):

1. **Info** — name (required), description, starts_at / ends_at date pickers
2. **Settings** — active toggle, cumulative toggle, promotional-price-visibility toggle, tags chip input (autocomplete from existing tags), excluded_tags chip input (same autocomplete, distinct input)
3. **Exclusions** — boolean flag checkboxes (exclude_medicine, exclude_outlet, etc.; driven by config)
4. **Rules & Benefits** — tree builder (see below)

### Rule Group Tree Builder

- Recursive `RuleGroupNode` component; indented with L-shaped connector lines per level
- Background fill lightens by ~10% per nesting level (CSS `color-mix` or CSS variables)
- Group header: **AND/OR** pill toggle (left), action buttons (right): Add Rule (green), Add Sub-group (blue), Add Benefit (orange), Duplicate (purple, sub-groups only), Delete (red, sub-groups only)
- Rules rendered as inline cards: type dropdown (filterable combobox), type-specific inline fields, delete (red icon)
- Benefits rendered in a visually distinct zone at group bottom: orange divider with `BENEFITS` badge, each benefit is an inline card identical in layout to a rule card but orange-accented; includes collapsible Labels section (locale → string inputs)
- Every benefit card carries an **Applies to** segmented control (Whole order / Order line / Each piece) restricted to the values the selected benefit type allows, and a **Limits** row (`max_quantity`, `max_lines`, `quantity_step`, `max_discount`). Choosing `Whole order` hides the quantity limits, which are meaningless there. Entering a quantity limit reveals the **Which pieces** selector (`cart_order` labelled *First added*, `cheapest`, `most_expensive`) and makes it required — the write path rejects a cap without a selector, so the form must not let the operator reach that state
- The benefit card renders a one-line plain-language echo of the configured combination (*"20% off — the first 5 pieces across the cart, max $50"*), because `applies_to` + selector + three caps is precisely the combination operators mis-read
- Drag-and-drop within tree is type-scoped (rules→rule containers, sub-groups→sub-group containers, benefits→benefit containers); cross-type drops disabled
- Selecting a new rule type resets the data fields for that rule
- Deletion: sub-groups with children show confirmation dialog; empty sub-groups, rules, and benefits delete immediately
- Empty states: *"Add a rule or sub-group to define when this promotion activates."* and *"No benefits yet."*

### Promotional Codes (`/backend/codes`)

- Paginated `DataTable` (server-side) with filters: search, type, active
- Dynamic code rows: progress bar `generated / amount`, Generate action button
- Code detail (`/backend/codes/[id]`): full form + generated codes panel (modal with paginated list of individual codes, active status, copy-to-clipboard)

---

## Configuration

- Module API key for cart-facing endpoints: resolved via `api_keys` module with scope `promotions`
- Promotion exclusion flag definitions configurable via module settings (which flags exist, their labels)
- Code reservation TTL: configurable via module setting (default 24h)
- Tree size guardrails: configurable limits enforced at the API layer; requests exceeding any limit return 422

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `max_tree_depth` | `10` | Prevent recursion abuse |
| `max_nodes_per_promotion` | `200` | Prevent oversized trees |
| `max_rules_per_group` | `25` | Prevent wide groups |
| `max_benefits_per_group` | `10` | Prevent excessive benefit fan-out |

---

## Extensibility

The promotions module is designed so that other modules (enterprise, loyalty, POS, partner integrations) can add custom rule types, custom benefit types, evaluation middleware, and admin configurator UI — all without touching core promotions code.

### Extension Registry (Server-Side)

`lib/extension-registry.ts` exports `PromotionExtensionRegistry`, registered as a singleton in `di.ts` and resolvable by any other module's DI registrar.

```typescript
// lib/extension-registry.ts

export interface RuleExtension {
  /** Discriminator key, globally unique. Use namespaced form: '<module>.<rule>', e.g. 'loyalty.tier_membership' */
  type: string
  /** Human-readable label per locale, shown in the rule type dropdown */
  label: Record<string, string>
  description?: Record<string, string>
  /** Zod schema used to validate the config JSONB at write time */
  configSchema: z.ZodSchema
  /**
   * Evaluates whether the rule is satisfied.
   * MUST be pure given the same inputs — no DB access, no side effects.
   * Extension-specific context data is passed via `context.extensions[type]`.
   */
  evaluate(config: unknown, context: CartContext): boolean
  /**
   * Keys the extension needs from context.extensions.
   * Declared so cart integrations know what to include in the request body.
   */
  contextKeys?: string[]
}

export interface BenefitExtension {
  /** Discriminator key. Use namespaced form: '<module>.<benefit>', e.g. 'loyalty.points_multiplier' */
  type: string
  label: Record<string, string>
  description?: Record<string, string>
  configSchema: z.ZodSchema
  /**
   * Application targets this benefit supports, and the one used when the
   * operator does not choose. Core stores `applies_to` on the benefit row and
   * validates it against this list — it never parses the extension's config to
   * find out what the benefit applies to.
   */
  supportedAppliesTo: BenefitAppliesTo[]
  defaultAppliesTo: BenefitAppliesTo
  /**
   * Resolves the benefit into concrete ResolvedEffect[].
   * MUST be pure — no DB access, no side effects.
   *
   * `selection` is the already-ordered, already-budgeted set of units core
   * resolved from the shared cap block — the extension prices it and does not
   * re-apply the caps. Under `applies_to: 'order'` it arrives empty.
   *
   * An extension is free to ignore `selection` and resolve effects from its own
   * config instead; core cannot stop it, so `capsHonoured: false` declares that
   * up front and the extension-types endpoint surfaces it, rather than an
   * operator discovering an uncapped benefit from an overspent campaign.
   */
  resolve(config: unknown, context: CartContext, selection: UnitSelection): ResolvedEffect[]
  /** Whether `resolve` honours `selection`. Surfaced to the admin UI. */
  capsHonoured: boolean
}

/**
 * The unit set a capped benefit may discount, produced by
 * `selectUnits(benefit, context)` in `lib/unit-selection.ts` — ordered by the
 * benefit's `selector`, truncated to `max_quantity` / `max_lines` /
 * `quantity_step`, with the deterministic tie-break already applied.
 */
export type UnitSelection = {
  /** One entry per covered cart line, in selection order. */
  lines: Array<{
    cartLineId: string
    sku: string
    lineQuantity: number
    /** How many of this line's units the budget covered; ≤ lineQuantity. */
    appliedQuantity: number
    unitPriceNet: string
    unitPriceGross: string
  }>
  /** Total units covered across every line — the spent budget. */
  totalQuantity: number
}

export interface EvaluationMiddleware {
  /** Stable ID for deduplication; use namespaced form: '<module>.<name>' */
  id: string
  /**
   * Runs before evaluation begins.
   * May return a modified CartContext (e.g. loyalty module appends tier info to context.extensions).
   * Must not mutate the original context object — return a new reference.
   */
  beforeEvaluate?(context: CartContext): Promise<CartContext>
  /**
   * Runs after all effects are resolved.
   * May filter, augment, or reorder the effects list.
   * Must not mutate the original array — return a new reference.
   */
  afterResolve?(effects: AppliedPromotion[], context: CartContext): Promise<AppliedPromotion[]>
}

export interface CodeMiddleware {
  id: string
  /**
   * Runs inside the serializable transaction before `use-code` finalises.
   * Throw a typed error to veto the code use (e.g. loyalty module vetoes if eligibility check fails).
   */
  beforeCodeUse?(codeId: string, context: CartContext): Promise<void>
  /**
   * Runs after `use-code` commits successfully (outside the transaction).
   * Used for side effects such as awarding loyalty points.
   */
  afterCodeUse?(codeId: string, context: CartContext): Promise<void>
}

export class PromotionExtensionRegistry {
  registerRuleType(ext: RuleExtension): void
  registerBenefitType(ext: BenefitExtension): void
  registerEvaluationMiddleware(middleware: EvaluationMiddleware): void
  registerCodeMiddleware(middleware: CodeMiddleware): void

  getRuleExtension(type: string): RuleExtension | undefined
  getBenefitExtension(type: string): BenefitExtension | undefined

  getAllRuleExtensions(): RuleExtension[]
  getAllBenefitExtensions(): BenefitExtension[]
  getEvaluationMiddlewares(): EvaluationMiddleware[]
  getCodeMiddlewares(): CodeMiddleware[]
}
```

**Registration pattern** — another module registers extensions in its own `di.ts`:

```typescript
// packages/core/src/modules/loyalty/di.ts
import { PromotionExtensionRegistry } from '@open-mercato/core/modules/promotions/lib/extension-registry'
import { loyaltyTierRule } from './promotions/loyalty-tier-rule'
import { loyaltyPointsMultiplierBenefit } from './promotions/loyalty-points-benefit'

export function register(container: AwilixContainer) {
  const registry = container.resolve<PromotionExtensionRegistry>('promotionExtensionRegistry')
  registry.registerRuleType(loyaltyTierRule)
  registry.registerBenefitType(loyaltyPointsMultiplierBenefit)
}
```

**Evaluation engine integration** — `lib/evaluation-engine.ts` resolves unknown rule/benefit types via the registry:

```
Pass 1 (boolean):
  Built-in rule types → lib/rule-evaluators.ts
  Unknown type        → registry.getRuleExtension(type)?.evaluate(config, context) ?? false

Pass 3 (effect resolution):
  selection = selectUnits(benefit, context)   // ordering + cart-wide quantity budget
  Built-in benefit types → lib/effect-resolvers.ts(config, context, selection)
  Unknown type           → registry.getBenefitExtension(type)?.resolve(config, context, selection) ?? []
```

The middleware pipeline wraps the entire evaluation:

```
beforeEvaluate middlewares (ordered by registration)
  → evaluateGroup() → collectBenefits() → resolveEffects()
afterResolve middlewares (ordered by registration)
  → return AppliedPromotion[]
```

**Constraints on extension evaluators:**

- MUST be synchronous (extensions returning `Promise` are rejected at registration time with a clear error)
- MUST NOT access the database, entity manager, or any I/O — all required data must be declared via `contextKeys` and supplied by the cart in `context.extensions`
- MUST return a deterministic result for the same inputs
- Config JSONB is validated against `configSchema` at write time; evaluators may safely assume the config is valid

**Validation integration** — `data/validators.ts` accepts extension types in the Zod discriminated union via a passthrough branch:

```typescript
// In the rule config discriminated union:
z.discriminatedUnion('rule_type', [
  // ... 15 built-in branches ...
  z.object({ rule_type: z.string(), config: z.unknown() })  // extension fallback; validated by extension's own configSchema
])
```

At write time, the API command resolves the extension from the registry and runs `extension.configSchema.parse(config)` before persisting, producing the same 422 validation errors as built-in types.

---

### Client-Side Configurator Registry

`lib/extension-registry.client.ts` provides a browser-side registry that maps extension type keys to React configurator components. The tree builder (`components/RuleGroupNode`) calls this registry when the selected rule/benefit type is not a built-in type.

```typescript
// lib/extension-registry.client.ts

export interface ConfiguratorProps<TConfig = unknown> {
  config: TConfig
  onChange(config: TConfig): void
  errors?: Record<string, string>
  locale: string
}

export interface RuleConfiguratorExtension {
  type: string
  label: Record<string, string>
  component: React.ComponentType<ConfiguratorProps>
}

export interface BenefitConfiguratorExtension {
  type: string
  label: Record<string, string>
  component: React.ComponentType<ConfiguratorProps>
}

export const promotionExtensionConfiguratorRegistry = {
  registerRule(ext: RuleConfiguratorExtension): void
  registerBenefit(ext: BenefitConfiguratorExtension): void
  getRule(type: string): RuleConfiguratorExtension | undefined
  getBenefit(type: string): BenefitConfiguratorExtension | undefined
  getAllRules(): RuleConfiguratorExtension[]
  getAllBenefits(): BenefitConfiguratorExtension[]
}
```

**Registration pattern** — another module registers its configurator component in its own `notifications.client.ts` or module entry point that is loaded by the app shell:

```typescript
// packages/core/src/modules/loyalty/promotions/configurators.client.ts
import { promotionExtensionConfiguratorRegistry } from '@open-mercato/core/modules/promotions/lib/extension-registry.client'
import { LoyaltyTierRuleConfigurator } from './LoyaltyTierRuleConfigurator'

promotionExtensionConfiguratorRegistry.registerRule({
  type: 'loyalty.tier_membership',
  label: { en: 'Customer loyalty tier', pl: 'Poziom lojalności klienta' },
  component: LoyaltyTierRuleConfigurator,
})
```

**Tree builder integration** — `components/RuleGroupNode.tsx` populates the rule type combobox by merging built-in rule descriptors with `promotionExtensionConfiguratorRegistry.getAllRules()`. When a rule card's `rule_type` matches an extension, the tree builder renders the extension's `component` instead of a built-in field set. The extension component receives `config` and `onChange`; the tree builder owns persistence.

The type dropdown groups extension types under a labelled section (e.g. `"Extensions"`) to distinguish them visually from built-in types.

---

### Widget Injection Points

The promotions module declares the following injection slots for other modules to inject UI widgets. Slot IDs follow the platform convention `<module>.<location>`.

| Slot ID | Location | Typical use |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `promotions.promotion-list.toolbar` | Right side of the promotion list header bar | Bulk action buttons, export controls |
| `promotions.promotion-detail.panels` | Below the standard 4 panels on the promotion form | Module-specific metadata panels (e.g. loyalty stats for a promotion) |
| `promotions.promotion-detail.sidebar` | Sidebar alongside the tree editor | Real-time preview, analytics breakdowns |
| `promotions.codes-list.toolbar` | Right side of the codes list header bar | Bulk export, import |
| `promotions.dashboard.stats` | Dashboard overview area | Promotion usage summary, active promotions count |

Injected widgets receive `{ promotionId?: string, organizationId: string, tenantId: string }` as props via the standard widget context.

Slot declarations live in `widgets/injection-table.ts` following the platform's widget injection pattern.

---

### Extensible Cart Context

The `CartContext` (accepted by `POST /api/promotions/evaluate` / `promotionsService.evaluate()`) is extended with an open-ended `extensions` field to let cart integrations supply extension-specific data:

```jsonc
{
  // ... existing fields ...
  "extensions": {
    "loyalty.tier_membership": { "tier": "gold", "points": 1240 },
    "enterprise.contract_pricing": { "contractId": "uuid" }
  }
}
```

Extension rule evaluators receive the full context and should read from `context.extensions[ext.type]`. The `contextKeys` field declared on each `RuleExtension` is surfaced via `GET /api/promotions/extension-types` so cart integrations know exactly which keys to populate.

---

## Migration & Compatibility

- All tables created via MikroORM migrations (`yarn db:generate` → `yarn db:migrate`)
- No existing promotions data — clean migration, no backfill required
- Cart-facing API is additive; existing cart/POS integrations are unaffected until they opt in
- POS module (SPEC-022) deferred promotions to Phase 3 — this module enables that integration
- The 2.1.0 amendment (`applies_to`, quantity caps, quantity-aware `LINE_DISCOUNT`) breaks no contract surface: `promotions` and `cart` are both unimplemented at the time of writing, so `promotion_benefits` has no rows to backfill and no external caller consumes a `ResolvedEffect` yet. It touches no shipped module — §B.6 maps line effects onto `SalesLineSnapshot` fields that `sales` already exposes, and §B.7 defers the `sales` change that would have been a contract surface

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 — Domain Model & Core Admin

**Goal:** Operators can create, edit, and delete promotions with a full rule-benefit tree. Data persists correctly. All entities, migrations, and CRUD in place.

1. Scaffold module: `index.ts`, `acl.ts`, `events.ts`, `setup.ts`, `di.ts`, `ce.ts`, `translations.ts`
2. Write all MikroORM entities in `data/entities.ts` (Promotion, RuleGroup, Rule with `rule_type` + `config jsonb`, Benefit with `benefit_type` + `applies_to` + `config jsonb`)
3. Write Zod validators in `data/validators.ts` for all entities and API inputs, including the shared quantity-cap block (`max_quantity`, `max_lines`, `quantity_step`) intersected into every benefit variant, the per-type `applies_to` allow-list, and the two write-path rejections from §B.4 — a cap without a `selector`, and `selector: all` combined with a cap (`TC-PROM-062`)
4. Generate and apply DB migration (`yarn db:generate && yarn db:migrate`)
5. Implement `commands/promotions.ts` — create/update/delete with undo support, events, cache invalidation
6. Implement `commands/rule-tree.ts` — atomic tree reconciliation command using `withAtomicFlush`
7. Implement `api/promotions/route.ts` (list, create, update, delete) using `makeCrudRoute` + `indexer`
8. Implement `api/promotions/[id]/route.ts` (detail with nested tree eager-load)
9. Implement `PUT /api/promotions/[id]/tree` — tree reconciliation endpoint
10. Implement `PATCH /api/promotions/order` — batch order update
11. Build backend list page (`backend/promotions/page.tsx`) — card layout, drag-sort, filters, batch save
12. Build promotion form pages (create + detail) — 4 panels, tag chip inputs
13. Build `RuleGroupNode` recursive tree component with AND/OR toggle, action buttons, type dropdowns for all 15 rule types, benefit zone, drag-within-tree
14. Add the benefit card's **Applies to** segmented control, **Limits** row and conditional **Which pieces** selector (§UI/UX), wired so a capped benefit cannot be saved without a selector, plus the plain-language echo line
15. Run `npm run modules:prepare` and `yarn generate`
16. Integration tests: promotion CRUD, tree save, order batch update, `applies_to` persistence and the write-path rejections (`TC-PROM-062`, `TC-PROM-067`, `TC-PROM-071`)

### Phase 2 — Evaluation Engine & Cart API

**Goal:** Cart module can call the promotions API and receive correct benefit descriptors.

1. Implement `lib/evaluation-engine.ts` — three-pass recursive evaluator accepting `NormalizedPromotion[]`; MUST NOT depend on MikroORM entities or any DB access; applies deterministic ordering (`ORDER BY order ASC, id ASC`); currency eligibility check before Pass 1 (`eligibleCurrencies` vs `context.currency`); optimistic budget pre-check before Pass 1 (`totalDiscountGranted >= maxBudget`); Pass 3 calls effect resolvers with the cart context to compute final amounts
2. Implement `lib/rule-evaluators.ts` — all 15 concrete rule evaluators with context key declarations; evaluators receive normalized `config` objects only
3. Implement `lib/unit-selection.ts` — `selectUnits(benefit, context)` expands qualifying cart lines into an ordered unit (or line) sequence per `selector`, applies the deterministic tie-break, then spends the cart-wide `max_quantity` / `max_lines` / `quantity_step` budget and returns the selection. Held here rather than inside a per-line loop because the budget spans lines (§B.3); exported for extension benefit types (§Extensibility)
4. Implement `lib/effect-resolvers.ts` — all 6 concrete effect resolvers; each resolver maps a `NormalizedBenefit` config + cart context to one or more `ResolvedEffect` objects with computed amounts and resolved SKUs; no math may live outside this file. Resolvers for `product_discount`, `cart_discount`, `buy_x_get_y`, and `tiered_discount` must apply `max_discount` capping after computing the raw amount: `effectiveAmount = min(rawAmount, config.max_discount ?? Infinity)`. Line-targeted resolvers consume the `selectUnits` result and emit one `LINE_DISCOUNT` per covered line carrying `appliesTo`, `lineQuantity`, `appliedQuantity` and `unitAmount` (§B.5), never one effect per unit
5. Implement `lib/tag-exclusion.ts` — promotion ordering + cumulativity + tag exclusion loop
6. Implement `services/promotion-cache.ts` — tenant-scoped active promotions cache: fully eager-load all promotions with complete rule/benefit trees, aggregate `totalDiscountGranted` per promotion from `promotion_usages WHERE reverted_at IS NULL`, normalize entity graphs into `NormalizedPromotion[]` (mapping `promotion_rules`/`promotion_benefits` jsonb rows directly to `{ type, config }` shape, pre-sorting arrays by `sort_order`, deep-freezing in non-production builds), cache per key `promotions:active:{tenantId}:{organizationId}`; subscriber in `subscribers/invalidate-promotion-cache.ts` with broad invalidation on any `promotions.*` mutation event or usage event (`promotions.usage.registered`, `promotions.usage.reverted`)
7. Implement `api/evaluate/route.ts` (was `api/cart/apply-promotion/route.ts` — Amendment §A.3) — full cart evaluation endpoint
8. Implement `api/dynamic-labels/route.ts`, `api/free-products/route.ts`, `api/delivery-methods/route.ts`
9. Implement `lib/product-page-engine.ts` — lightweight variant that evaluates active promotions against a list of SKUs; implement `api/product-page/route.ts` consuming it
10. Integration tests: evaluation engine unit tests for each rule type with assertion that zero DB calls occur during evaluation; end-to-end apply-promotion API tests asserting `ResolvedEffect` amounts (not raw percentages), `ADD_FREE_ITEM` SKU resolution, cumulativity, tag exclusion, sub-group benefit collection; performance benchmark captured for ≥ 100 promotions; cap and targeting behaviour per `TC-PROM-058`–`TC-PROM-061`, `TC-PROM-063`–`TC-PROM-065`, `TC-PROM-069`, `TC-PROM-070`, `TC-PROM-072`

### Phase 3 — Codes System

**Goal:** Operators can manage code templates; cart can validate, reserve, and finalize code redemptions.

1. Write `Code`, `GeneratedCode`, `CodeReservation`, `CodeUsage` entities and validators
2. Generate and apply migration
3. Implement `commands/codes.ts` — code CRUD with undo, events
4. Implement `lib/code-service.ts` — validation, per-customer limit check, reservation, use, delete
5. Implement `workers/code-generation.worker.ts` — background batch generator with uniqueness validation; register queue `promotions.code.generate`
6. Implement `services/code-generation.ts` — triggers worker, tracks progress
7. Implement `api/codes/route.ts`, `api/codes/[id]/generate/route.ts`, `api/codes/[id]/generated/route.ts`
8. Implement code endpoints under `api/codes/`: `reserve`, `validate`, `use`, `release` (was `cart/add-code`, `cart/validate-code`, `cart/use-code`, `cart/delete-code` — Amendment §A.3)
9. Build codes backend pages: list, create, detail with generated codes panel
10. Write `PromotionUsage` entity and validators; generate and apply migration
11. Implement `lib/promotion-usage-service.ts` — `registerUsage` (serializable transaction, budget cap enforcement, idempotent upsert, `promotions.promotion.budget-exhausted` emission on first budget hit), `revertUsage` (bulk `reverted_at` update), `getBudgetConsumed`
12. Implement `api/usage/register/route.ts` (was `api/cart/register-usage/route.ts` — Amendment §A.3) — loops `appliedPromotions`, calls `registerUsage` per promotion, returns 207 Multi-Status with `budgetExceeded` flag for any promotions that were blocked; exports `openApi`
13. Implement `api/usage/revert/route.ts` (was `api/cart/revert-usage/route.ts` — Amendment §A.3) — calls `revertUsage`, returns `{ ok: true, revertedCount }`; exports `openApi`
14. Update `subscribers/invalidate-promotion-cache.ts` to also subscribe to `promotions.usage.registered` and `promotions.usage.reverted` for cache invalidation
15. Register `PromotionUsageService` in `di.ts`
16. Integration tests: `TC-PROM-023` – `TC-PROM-026` (see Testing Strategy)

### Phase 4 — Search, Notifications & Polish

**Goal:** Promotions are searchable; operators receive relevant notifications; edge cases handled.

1. Implement `search.ts` — fulltext indexing for promotions (name, description, tags) and codes (name, code)
2. Implement `notifications.ts` — code pool exhaustion notification (`promotions.code.exhausted` event), promotion expiring-soon notification
3. Implement `subscribers/` for notification events
4. Add i18n locale files (`i18n/en.json`, `i18n/pl.json`, etc.)
5. Declare widget injection slots in `widgets/injection-table.ts`: `promotions.promotion-list.toolbar`, `promotions.promotion-detail.panels`, `promotions.promotion-detail.sidebar`, `promotions.codes-list.toolbar`, `promotions.dashboard.stats`
6. POS integration event subscription: `pos.cart.completed` → trigger `use-code` if code in session
7. Final compliance and spec update
8. Integration tests: `TC-PROM-030` Search indexing, `TC-PROM-031` Notification on code exhaustion, `TC-PROM-032` Notification on promotion expiring soon

### Phase 5 — Extension Infrastructure

**Goal:** Other modules can register custom rule types, benefit types, evaluation middleware, and admin configurator UI against the promotions module without modifying any promotions file.

1. Implement `lib/extension-registry.ts` — `PromotionExtensionRegistry` class; `registerRuleType`, `registerBenefitType`, `registerEvaluationMiddleware`, `registerCodeMiddleware`; validate at registration that evaluators are synchronous functions; log a warning on duplicate `type` registration (last-registered wins)
2. Register `PromotionExtensionRegistry` as a singleton in `di.ts` under the token `promotionExtensionRegistry`
3. Update `lib/evaluation-engine.ts` — resolve unknown rule types from registry in Pass 1; resolve unknown benefit types from registry in Pass 3; run `EvaluationMiddleware.beforeEvaluate` chain before Pass 1; run `EvaluationMiddleware.afterResolve` chain after Pass 3; pass `context.extensions` through unchanged to all evaluators
4. Update `lib/code-service.ts` — call `CodeMiddleware.beforeCodeUse` inside the serializable transaction; call `CodeMiddleware.afterCodeUse` after transaction commits; wrap `beforeCodeUse` errors as 422 responses with the thrown message
5. Update `data/validators.ts` — add extension passthrough branch to the Zod discriminated union for `rule_type` and `benefit_type`; run `extension.configSchema.parse(config)` in commands for unknown types before persisting
6. Extend `CartContext` type to include `extensions?: Record<string, unknown>`; update the `POST /api/promotions/evaluate` Zod schema and OpenAPI spec to include the `extensions` field
7. Implement `api/extension-types/route.ts` — `GET`, resolves registry from DI, maps to response shape, exports `openApi`; requires `requireAuth` + `promotions.view`
8. Implement `lib/extension-registry.client.ts` — `promotionExtensionConfiguratorRegistry` object; `registerRule`, `registerBenefit`, `getRule`, `getBenefit`, `getAllRules`, `getAllBenefits`
9. Update `components/RuleGroupNode.tsx` tree builder — fetch `/api/promotions/extension-types` once on mount; merge extension entries into rule type and benefit type comboboxes under an `"Extensions"` group heading; render extension component from client registry when selected type is not built-in; fall back to a `<JsonConfigEditor>` (raw JSON textarea with schema validation) when a type is present in server metadata but has no registered client configurator
10. Integration tests: `TC-PROM-040` Register a test rule extension, create a promotion using it, verify evaluation returns correct result; `TC-PROM-041` Register a test benefit extension, verify effect is present in `apply-promotion` response; `TC-PROM-042` `beforeEvaluate` middleware can inject data into `context.extensions`; `TC-PROM-043` `afterResolve` middleware can filter effects; `TC-PROM-044` `beforeCodeUse` middleware can veto code use with 422; `TC-PROM-045` Extension type appears in `GET /api/promotions/extension-types` response

### File Manifest (Phase 1 critical files)

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `promotions/index.ts` | Create | Module metadata |
| `promotions/acl.ts` | Create | Feature definitions |
| `promotions/events.ts` | Create | Typed events with `as const` |
| `promotions/setup.ts` | Create | Tenant init + defaultRoleFeatures |
| `promotions/di.ts` | Create | DI registrar |
| `promotions/data/entities.ts` | Create | All MikroORM entities |
| `promotions/data/validators.ts` | Create | All Zod schemas |
| `promotions/commands/promotions.ts` | Create | CRUD commands with undo |
| `promotions/commands/rule-tree.ts` | Create | Atomic tree reconciliation |
| `promotions/api/promotions/route.ts` | Create | CRUD route with makeCrudRoute |
| `promotions/backend/promotions/page.tsx` | Create | List page |
| `promotions/backend/promotions/[id]/page.tsx` | Create | Detail + tree editor |

### Testing Strategy

Integration tests for each phase following `.ai/qa/AGENTS.md`:
- Phase 1: `TC-PROM-001` Promotion CRUD, `TC-PROM-002` Rule tree save/load, `TC-PROM-003` Order batch update
- Phase 2: `TC-PROM-010` Apply-promotion returns resolved amounts (not raw percentages) for each rule type, `TC-PROM-011` Cumulativity + tag exclusion, `TC-PROM-012` Sub-group benefit collection, `TC-PROM-013` ADD_FREE_ITEM effect carries correct SKU + quantity for FreeProduct and BuyXGetY, `TC-PROM-014` `max_discount` cap — a `cart_discount` benefit with `value: "10%"` and `max_discount: "100"` applied to a $1500 cart produces `amount: "-100"` (capped), not `"-150"`
- Phase 3: `TC-PROM-020` Code lifecycle, `TC-PROM-021` Per-customer limit, `TC-PROM-022` Concurrent reservation race, `TC-PROM-023` `register-usage` writes `PromotionUsage` row with correct `effects_snapshot` and `total_discount_amount`, `TC-PROM-024` `revert-usage` sets `reverted_at` on all matching rows (never deletes); `getBudgetConsumed` decrements accordingly, `TC-PROM-025` Budget cap enforcement — promotion with `max_budget: "500"` accepts registrations until cumulative hits 500, then blocks with 207 + `budgetExceeded: true` and emits `promotions.promotion.budget-exhausted`; cache refresh causes post-exhaustion `apply-promotion` to skip the promotion, `TC-PROM-026` Currency eligibility — promotion with `eligible_currencies: ["EUR"]` is excluded from `apply-promotion` response when `currency: "USD"` is passed; included when `currency: "EUR"` is passed
- Phase 4: `TC-PROM-030` Search indexing, `TC-PROM-031` Notification on code exhaustion, `TC-PROM-032` Notification on promotion expiring soon
- Phase 5: `TC-PROM-040` Custom rule extension evaluation, `TC-PROM-041` Custom benefit extension effect resolution, `TC-PROM-042` `beforeEvaluate` middleware context injection, `TC-PROM-043` `afterResolve` middleware effect filtering, `TC-PROM-044` `beforeCodeUse` veto, `TC-PROM-045` Extension type metadata endpoint

## Risks & Impact Review

### Data Integrity Failures

#### Rule Tree Atomicity
- **Scenario**: Operator submits a large tree update; server crashes after partial node writes. Some rule groups are orphaned; others reference deleted concrete rule records.
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected area**: Promotion evaluation (orphaned groups evaluate incorrectly), admin UI (shows corrupted tree)
- **Mitigation**: All tree mutations wrapped in a single database transaction via `withAtomicFlush({ transaction: true })`. Orphaned nodes are detected via cascade delete on promotion delete.
- **Residual risk**: Transaction rollback may silently discard large user edits — UI must detect 5xx and prompt re-edit.

#### Concurrent Code Reservation
- **Scenario**: Two browser sessions for the same customer both call `codes/reserve` (`/api/promotions/codes/reserve`, or `promotionsService.reserveCode()` in-process) with a code that has `usage_per_customer: 1` and 0 existing `CodeUsage` records. Both pass the limit check and both create a `CodeReservation`.
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected area**: Per-customer code limits
- **Mitigation**: `CodeReservation` creation is wrapped in a serialisable transaction that re-reads `CodeUsage` count + existing reservation count inside the transaction. A unique constraint on `(code_id, customer_id)` for active reservations enforces single-claim.
- **Residual risk**: Customers with very high checkout abandonment rates create many expired reservations; cleanup job required.

#### JSONB Config Schema Drift
- **Scenario**: A rule or benefit record is persisted with a `config` shape that no longer matches the current Zod schema (e.g. after a schema evolution). Evaluation engine receives unexpected config fields or missing required fields.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected area**: Evaluation engine (runtime error in rule evaluator or effect resolver)
- **Mitigation**: All writes go through Zod discriminated union validation in `data/validators.ts` before persisting. Evaluators defensively destructure only known fields and return `false` (not throw) on unrecognised shapes. Schema migrations for existing rows must be handled via a one-time data migration when field renames occur.
- **Residual risk**: Low — write-time validation prevents bad data entering the store; evaluator defensiveness contains runtime exposure.

### Cascading Failures & Side Effects

#### Cache Invalidation Lag
- **Scenario**: Operator deactivates a promotion. Cache is still serving the old active promotions list. Customers continue receiving benefits from the deactivated promotion for up to TTL seconds.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected area**: Cart apply-promotion endpoint
- **Mitigation**: Cache subscriber uses broad invalidation — any `promotions.*` mutation event evicts the relevant tenant-scoped cache entry immediately (not on TTL). Covered events: promotion created / updated / deleted, order changed, rule tree mutated, rule or benefit created / updated / deleted, active toggle, date window change, tags or exclusions change, code activation state change. Broad invalidation is preferred over selective eviction to prevent missed triggers.
- **Residual risk**: Event delivery latency (milliseconds on ephemeral subscriptions); acceptable for promotional context.

#### Evaluation Engine Depth Explosion
- **Scenario**: An operator constructs a rule tree 50 levels deep (accidentally or maliciously). The recursive evaluator stack-overflows.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected area**: `apply-promotion` endpoint
- **Mitigation**: Max tree depth enforced at API write time (default 10; configurable). Evaluator carries a depth counter and returns false at limit.
- **Residual risk**: Trees saved before limit enforcement are grandfathered — migration to enforce retroactively may be needed.

### Tenant & Data Isolation Risks

#### Cross-Tenant Code String Collision
- **Scenario**: Two tenants generate dynamic codes with identical strings. A customer from tenant A uses tenant B's code.
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected area**: Code validation
- **Mitigation**: All code lookups are scoped by `(tenant_id, organization_id, code_string)`. The UNIQUE constraint on `promotion_generated_codes.code` is per-tenant (partial unique index). `add-code` endpoint requires tenant scope from authenticated request context.
- **Residual risk**: None — isolation is index-enforced.

#### Promotion Cache Leakage
- **Scenario**: Promotion cache is keyed incorrectly (missing tenant scope). Tenant A's promotions served to tenant B.
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Affected area**: All cart evaluations
- **Mitigation**: Cache keys MUST include `tenantId` + `organizationId`. Cache implementation uses `@open-mercato/cache` with tenant-scoped tag invalidation. Code review checklist includes cache key inspection.
- **Residual risk**: Implementation error — mitigated by explicit cache key type that enforces required fields.

#### Budget Cap Race Window

- **Scenario**: Multiple concurrent orders for the same promotion all pass the optimistic budget pre-check (stale cache snapshot), then all call `register-usage` concurrently. The serializable transaction enforces the cap correctly on each commit, but two requests that entered the transaction at the same time may both see the remaining budget as sufficient before either has committed.
- **Severity**: Low — serializable isolation in PostgreSQL uses predicate locking to detect read-write conflicts. A transaction that reads and then increments the `SUM` aggregate will conflict with a concurrent transaction doing the same, causing one to retry or abort.
- **Affected area**: `max_budget` enforcement in `registerUsage`
- **Mitigation**: `registerUsage` runs at `ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE`; PostgreSQL's SSI detects the read-modify-write conflict and forces one transaction to retry. The retry logic re-reads the current sum and may block the second registration if the cap is now met.
- **Residual risk**: Marginal overshoot in edge cases with very high concurrent throughput (unlikely for promotions context); acceptable and consistent with how most e-commerce platforms handle budget caps.

### Migration & Deployment Risks

#### Migration Scope
- **Scenario**: Schema migration introduces `promotion_rules` and `promotion_benefits` tables. If migration fails, partial state is left.
- **Severity**: Low
- **Affected area**: Database schema
- **Mitigation**: MikroORM generates a single migration file; Postgres wraps it in a transaction. Rollback restores prior state completely. Total new tables are ~6 (down from 23 in the original design), reducing migration surface.
- **Residual risk**: Negligible — tables are empty on first deploy.

### Operational Risks

#### Dynamic Code Generation Stall
- **Scenario**: Worker process crashes mid-generation. `generated` counter does not match actual count of `GeneratedCode` rows.
- **Severity**: Low
- **Affected area**: Code pool accuracy
- **Mitigation**: Worker is idempotent — on restart it queries `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM promotion_generated_codes WHERE code_id = ?` to determine actual generated count, then continues from there. `Code.generated` is reconciled on worker completion, not incremented per-insert.
- **Residual risk**: Temporary display inconsistency in admin UI between worker runs; acceptable.

#### Promotion List Performance at Scale
- **Scenario**: An organization accumulates 10,000 promotions. The list endpoint loads all of them (spec says all are loaded at once for drag-sort).
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected area**: Admin list page
- **Mitigation**: In Phase 1, enforce a soft limit (warn at 500, hard limit at 1000 per organization). Active promotions cache is separate from admin list — cache only loads `active=true` AND within date range. Admin list uses paginated query with server-side filters; drag-sort operates on the filtered subset.
- **Residual risk**: Operators with very large promotion archives need bulk archive/cleanup tooling (Phase 4 scope).

## Final Compliance Report — 2026-02-23

### Addendum — 2026-08-17 (Amendment reconciliation)

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| Command pattern for financially consequential writes | `reserveCode`/`releaseCode`/`useCode`/`registerUsage`/`revertUsage` implemented as registered commands (§A.2a) |
| Cross-module coupling direction | `cart` → `promotions` is a hard dependency, not an optional `tryResolve` peer (§A.2b) — documented rationale, not a silent omission |
| DI contract completeness | `PromotionsService` covers all 7 cart-facing operations (§A.2, fixed) |
| Internal consistency of the `/api/cart/*` → `/api/promotions/*` rename | All references across the document updated (§A.3, fixed) |

### Addendum — 2026-09-07 (Application target and quantity caps)

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| No cross-module coupling introduced | §B.6 maps line effects onto `SalesLineSnapshot` fields `sales` already exposes; §B.7 defers the `SalesAdjustmentDraft.lineId` change to its own spec rather than editing a shipped module from a promotions amendment |
| No contract surface broken | Both `promotions` and `cart` are unimplemented; no rows to backfill, no external consumer of `ResolvedEffect` (§Migration & Compatibility) |
| Validation at the application boundary | `applies_to` allow-list, the shared quantity-cap block and the two capped-config rejections are Zod-validated in `data/validators.ts` (Phase 1 step 3), not merely documented |
| Determinism | Selector ordering has a specified tie-break (`cartLineId`, then unit index) so an unchanged cart re-evaluates identically (§B.4, `TC-PROM-064`) |
| No hard-coded user-facing strings | The admin control's labels (*Whole order* / *Order line* / *Each piece*, *First added*) and the plain-language echo line route through `translations.ts` like every other benefit-card string |

## Amendment — 2026-08-14: Alignment with the `cart` Module

This section is normative. Where it conflicts with *API Contracts → Cart-Facing Endpoints*, this section wins.

### A.1 What changed underneath this spec

Version 1.0 assumed the cart lived outside the platform: endpoints authenticated by `X-Module-Key`, items addressed by `sku`, prices passed in as decimal strings, and the caller responsible for applying returned effects. That was the right design for an unknown external caller.

The platform now has [`cart`](./2026-08-14-cart-module.md), an in-process module that owns baskets for the storefront, POS, pay links and AI agents. It calls promotions on every mutation and hands the resolved effects to `salesCalculationService`. Three consequences follow.

### A.2 The primary integration is a DI service, not HTTP

`promotions/di.ts` registers `promotionsService`:

```typescript
export type PromotionEvaluationInput = {
  cart: CartContext              // §Extensible Cart Context, extended per A.4
  codes: Array<{ id: string; type: 'static' | 'dynamic' }>
  buyer: {
    customerId: string | null
    customerGroupIds: string[]   // priority-ordered; see spec 1 §3.2
    customerUserId: string | null
    channelId: string | null
  }
}

export interface PromotionsService {
  evaluate(input: PromotionEvaluationInput): Promise<ResolvedPromotions>
  evaluateForProduct(input: ProductPagePromotionInput): Promise<ProductPagePromotions>
  reserveCode(input: { codeString: string; cartId: string; customerId: string | null }): Promise<CodeReservationResult>
  validateCode(input: { codeString: string; cartId: string; customerId: string | null }): Promise<CodeValidationResult>
  useCode(input: { codeString: string; cartId: string; orderId: string; customerId: string | null }): Promise<CodeUseResult>
  releaseCode(input: { reservationId: string; reason: string }): Promise<void>
  registerUsage(input: RegisterUsageInput): Promise<RegisterUsageResult>
  revertUsage(input: RevertUsageInput): Promise<void>
}
```

**Fixed 2026-08-17**: the interface originally omitted `validateCode` and `useCode` — two of the seven cart-facing routes renamed in §A.3 had no DI method, which directly contradicted the "in-process callers MUST use the service" rule below for those two operations. Every renamed route now has a matching method; `codes/validate` and `codes/use` (§A.3) are the HTTP adapters over `validateCode`/`useCode`, same as the other five.

The HTTP endpoints remain, unchanged in behaviour, for genuinely external carts — a third-party storefront or a legacy shop integrating against Open Mercato. They become a thin adapter over the same service rather than the only door.

**In-process callers MUST use the service.** Routing an in-process call through HTTP would lose the request-scoped container, the transaction and the tenant scope, and would re-serialize a cart the callee could read directly. `cart` is the primary in-process caller for `evaluate`/`reserveCode`/`releaseCode`, but `useCode`/`registerUsage`/`revertUsage` are architecturally destined to be called by `checkout` (spec 7, not yet written) at order confirmation/cancellation — this service is available to any in-process module, not only `cart`.

### A.2a Command pattern (fixed 2026-08-17)

`reserveCode`, `releaseCode`, `useCode`, `registerUsage` and `revertUsage` are all financially or budget consequential writes — root `AGENTS.md`'s "implement domain writes through commands" rule applies to them the same as to `Promotion`/`Code` CRUD, which already go through commands. Each is implemented as a registered command (`promotions.code.reserve`, `.release`, `.use`, `.usage.register`, `.usage.revert`), wrapping the existing serializable-transaction logic described in *Code Lifecycle* / *Promotion Usage Lifecycle* rather than replacing it — the transaction boundary and budget re-check stay exactly as specified there. `evaluate`/`evaluateForProduct` remain plain reads with no command wrapping, since they mutate nothing.

### A.2b Dependency direction (fixed 2026-08-17)

`cart` depends on `promotions` as a **hard** dependency, not an optional peer resolved via `tryResolve` (contrast with `wms`/`availability`, which are genuinely optional). Every cart mutation that changes lines or quantities calls `promotionsService.evaluate()` (§A.1); there is no meaningful "cart without a promotions engine" mode the way there is a "storefront without WMS" mode — an empty promotion set is simply the normal case when no promotions are configured, not an absent-module fallback. `cart`'s module manifest declares `requires: ['promotions']` accordingly.

### A.3 Namespace move — breaking, and necessary

The cart-facing endpoints move. **Fixed 2026-08-17**: this table originally listed a route (`remove-code`) that does not exist anywhere else in this document — the real route is `delete-code` — and omitted two real cart-facing routes (`validate-code`, `use-code`) entirely, which would have left them under `/api/cart/*` and defeated the whole point of this section. Corrected to cover all seven cart-facing routes actually defined in *API Contracts*:

| Was | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/cart/apply-promotion` | `POST /api/promotions/evaluate` |
| `POST /api/cart/add-code` | `POST /api/promotions/codes/reserve` |
| `POST /api/cart/validate-code` | `POST /api/promotions/codes/validate` |
| `POST /api/cart/use-code` | `POST /api/promotions/codes/use` |
| `POST /api/cart/delete-code` | `POST /api/promotions/codes/release` |
| `POST /api/cart/register-usage` | `POST /api/promotions/usage/register` |
| `POST /api/cart/revert-usage` | `POST /api/promotions/usage/revert` |

`/api/cart/*` belongs to the `cart` module (roadmap §9). Two modules serving one namespace would make route ownership ambiguous and would collide outright — `cart` defines `POST /api/cart/carts/:token/promotions`.

Nothing is deployed under the old paths, so this is a specification change and no deprecation protocol is triggered. Had they shipped, the old paths would need a redirect for one minor version.

**This table is the single source of truth for these seven routes.** Every other section of this document — module file structure, *API Contracts* headers, the implementation plan — must read the `/api/promotions/*` path on the right, not the `/api/cart/*` path on the left; occurrences of the old paths elsewhere in this document that were not updated in this pass are a defect, not an alternative.

### A.4 Cart context: ids alongside SKUs

`CartContext.items[]` gains three fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `productId` | `string` | `catalog.CatalogProduct.id` |
| `variantId` | `string \| null` | |
| `cartLineId` | `string` | Identifies the line for effect targeting |

`sku` is retained and still populated — external callers may have nothing else, and SKU-based rules (`producerCode`, category slug matching) keep working.

**Effect targeting changes from `targetSku` to `targetCartLineId`,** with `targetSku` retained for external callers. A cart may legitimately hold two lines with the same SKU and different `configuration` (engraving, B2B configurator output); `targetSku` cannot distinguish them, so a line discount would land on the wrong line or be applied twice.

`CartContext` also gains:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `customerGroupIds` | `string[]` | Enables group-scoped promotions — the B2B case v1.0 could not express |
| `taxMode` | `'gross' \| 'net'` | Disambiguates the basis of returned amounts (A.5) |
| `storeId` | `string \| null` | Per-store campaigns |

A new built-in rule type `customer_group` matches against `customerGroupIds` using set membership. Without it, a wholesale-only promotion has to be expressed as a list of customer ids.

### A.5 Effects map onto `SalesAdjustmentDraft`

`cart` does not apply discounts itself; it forwards them to `salesCalculationService` as `SalesAdjustmentDraft[]`. The existing effect shape maps cleanly, with one gap closed.

| Effect field | `SalesAdjustmentDraft` field |
|---|---|
| `promotionId` | `promotionId` |
| `label` (resolved for the locale) | `label` |
| `type: 'LINE_DISCOUNT'` | `scope: 'line'` — **superseded by Amendment §B.6**: `sales` rejects a line-attributed adjustment draft today, so line effects travel on the line snapshot instead |
| `type: 'CART_DISCOUNT' \| 'DELIVERY_DISCOUNT'` | `scope: 'order'` |
| `amount` | `amountNet` **or** `amountGross` — see below |
| code | `code` |

**The gap.** v1.0 returns `amount` as a negative decimal string without stating whether it is net or gross, while the request supplies both `unitPrice` (ex-tax) and `unitPriceIncTax`. `salesCalculationService` needs to know which basis it received or it will apply tax to an already-taxed discount.

Resolution: every effect gains a required `basis: 'net' | 'gross'` field. The engine computes against the basis matching `CartContext.taxMode` and states it. Amounts remain negative decimal strings on the wire and are parsed to numbers at the `SalesAdjustmentDraft` boundary.

`ADD_FREE_ITEM` does not map to an adjustment — it instructs `cart` to insert a line at zero price with `added_by: 'merge'` semantics and a `promotionId` marker. Such a line is **excluded from the next evaluation's eligibility computation**, or a buy-2-get-1 promotion re-triggers on its own free item and loops. This exclusion is an explicit invariant, tested.

### A.6 Code reservations follow the cart's lifecycle

`CodeReservation` gains `cart_id`. Reservations are released when:

- the code is removed from the cart
- the cart is abandoned (ahead of full expiry — a 30-day cart holding a limited code for 30 days exhausts a campaign against baskets nobody bought)
- the cart expires
- the cart is merged and the target cart already holds the code

Reservation TTL is independent of and shorter than cart TTL. `cart`'s expiry sweeper calls `releaseCode`; `promotions` also sweeps independently, because a reservation must not depend on another module's job succeeding.

### A.7 Evaluation cost

`cart` evaluates on every line mutation. Two obligations follow:

1. **Batch mutations evaluate once.** `POST /api/cart/carts/:token/lines/bulk` results in a single `evaluate` call. A 50-line B2B quick order must not run 50 passes.
2. **Latency budget:** P95 under 150 ms for a 50-line cart against 200 active promotions. Measured at the Phase 2 gate of the suite. If the three-pass engine cannot meet it, the mitigation is a narrowed candidate set from the cache build — not caching the evaluation result, which depends on the whole cart and would key on the cart itself.

### A.8 Risks added

| # | Risk | Severity | Failure scenario | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A-R1 | Discount basis confusion | **High** | An effect computed on gross is applied by `salesCalculationService` as net; tax is charged on a discount that already included it. Every promoted order is mispriced. | Required `basis` field (A.5); a property test asserts cart totals with promotions equal order totals with the same promotions | Low |
| A-R2 | Free-item feedback loop | **High** | A buy-2-get-1 free item counts toward its own trigger; each evaluation adds another free item until a cap or a timeout. | Promotion-inserted lines excluded from eligibility (A.5), tested explicitly; a per-evaluation cap on inserted items as a backstop | Low |
| A-R3 | Line targeting collision | Medium | Two lines share a SKU with different configurations; a `targetSku` discount lands on the wrong line or twice. | `targetCartLineId` for in-process callers (A.4) | Low |
| A-R4 | Reservation leak across cart lifetime | Medium | Abandoned carts hold single-use codes; a limited campaign exhausts against baskets nobody bought. | Independent shorter reservation TTL; release on abandonment; both modules sweep (A.6) | Low |
| A-R5 | Evaluation latency on bulk B2B carts | Medium | 50-line quick order × 200 promotions blocks the mutation response. | Single evaluation per batch; latency budget gated (A.7) | Medium — depends on engine performance, measured before Phase 2 exit |

### A.9 Additional test cases

- `TC-PROM-050` — In-process `promotionsService.evaluate` and `POST /api/promotions/evaluate` return identical effects for the same context
- `TC-PROM-051` — `customer_group` rule matches on set membership, including a buyer in several groups
- `TC-PROM-052` — Effect `basis` matches `CartContext.taxMode`; cart totals with promotions equal order totals with the same promotions (A-R1)
- `TC-PROM-053` — A promotion-inserted free line does not count toward its own trigger across three consecutive evaluations (A-R2)
- `TC-PROM-054` — Two lines with the same SKU and different `configuration` receive independent line discounts (A-R3)
- `TC-PROM-055` — Reservation released on cart abandonment, expiry, code removal, and merge into a cart already holding the code (A-R4)
- `TC-PROM-056` — A 100-line bulk add triggers exactly one evaluation (A.7)
- `TC-PROM-057` — 50-line cart against 200 active promotions evaluates within the P95 budget

## Amendment — 2026-09-07: Benefit application target and quantity caps

> Normative over §*Data Models — Benefit*, §*Cart-Facing Endpoints — Resolved Effect Types*, and the `LINE_DISCOUNT` row of §A.5. The affected tables in the body of this spec have been updated in place; this section records why.

### B.1 What was missing

A benefit never stated what it was applied to. The target was implied by `benefit_type` and written down nowhere, so three questions an operator asks on day one had no answer in this document:

1. *Is this discount on the whole order, on a line, or on each piece?* Implied per type, unqueryable, and invisible to `cart`, which has to map the effect without being told.
2. *Can I cap it at the first 5 pieces?* `product_discount` carried `pcs_limit` described in a single sentence — "caps the total number of items that receive the discount regardless of `selector`" — that never said whether the count is per line, per cart, or per satisfied rule. `tiered_discount` had no such field at all.
3. *Which 5 pieces?* `selector` orders only by price (`nth` is explicitly "1-indexed in ascending price order"), so "the first five" — the reading almost every operator intends — was not expressible at all.

Two smaller defects fell out of the same hole. `tiered_discount` carried `scope: cart|line` while `product_discount` carried `pcs_limit`: the same business decision, split across two field names on two types. And `delivery_discount.scope` was declared `scope text` with its value set defined nowhere in this document — a field no implementer could have built.

### B.2 `applies_to` is a column, not a config field

The three targets are `order`, `line` and `unit`. `line` and `unit` differ in what a cap consumes: under `line` a cap spends whole lines and a line is covered entirely or not at all; under `unit` a cap spends individual units and a line may be partially covered. "20% off, max 5 pieces" against a single line of 8 therefore discounts 5 units under `unit` and nothing under `line` — a difference worth making the operator state.

It is stored as a column rather than inside `config` for two reasons that outweigh the consistency cost of breaking the "everything type-specific lives in the JSONB" pattern. First, `applies_to` decides the shape of the resolved effect and therefore how `cart` hands it to `salesCalculationService`; core must read it for extension benefit types whose `config` schema core does not own. Second, a field common to every variant of a Zod discriminated union is exactly the field a discriminated union models badly — it would have to be repeated in six schemas and could drift in any of them.

### B.3 The quantity budget is cart-wide and lives in Pass 3

`max_quantity` and `max_lines` count **across the whole cart per benefit invocation**. Per-line counting was rejected: a buyer defeats it by splitting a purchase across lines, and with configurable products the lines split on their own, so the cap would loosen for reasons unrelated to intent. Per-application counting (the `buy_x_get_y.max_applications` model) was rejected for the general case because a cap that resets on every trigger rarely binds, which is indistinguishable from having no cap while looking like one in the admin UI.

The consequence for the engine is structural, not cosmetic: a cart-wide budget cannot be enforced inside a per-line loop. `resolveEffects` orders every qualifying unit or line for the benefit first, then walks that order spending the budget. This is why the budget is drawn at Pass 3 in §*Evaluation Engine Data Flow* and not at the point where each line's amount is computed.

### B.4 Ordering is configured, never defaulted

`selector` is **required whenever `max_quantity` or `max_lines` is set**. There is deliberately no default. "The first 5 pieces" and "the 5 most expensive pieces" are different promotions with different costs against the same cart, and choosing silently for the operator is how a campaign overspends without anyone having decided anything. A capped config without a selector is a 422 at the write path, and the admin form must not let an operator reach that state.

On an uncapped benefit `selector: null` is read as `all` — there is no budget to spend, so every qualifying unit is covered and the ordering is irrelevant. `all` remains a distinct, explicitly stored value so an operator can state the intent; the two behave identically and both are rejected the moment a cap is added without the operator revisiting the selector.

`cart_order` is added to the selector value set for the literal "first N added" reading. Ties break on `cartLineId` ascending then unit index, so re-evaluating an unchanged cart returns byte-identical effects — a property the cart relies on to avoid spurious total changes between two reads of the same basket.

### B.5 `LINE_DISCOUNT` becomes quantity-aware

The effect gains `appliesTo`, `lineQuantity`, `appliedQuantity` and `unitAmount` alongside the existing `amount`. A partially covered line stays **one** effect: emitting one effect per unit (the Sylius `OrderItemUnit` model) would have broken the existing "one `LINE_DISCOUNT` per SKU per promotion" invariant and turned a 50-unit line into 50 entries in every evaluation response.

Without `appliedQuantity` the coverage is unrecoverable downstream. The cart cannot render *"5 of 8 pieces −20%"*, and a return of one piece has no basis on which to decide how much discount to reverse — the same total is consistent with 5 units at −2.40 and 8 units at −1.50.

### B.6 Mapping into `sales` — supersedes the `LINE_DISCOUNT` row of §A.5

§A.5 mapped `LINE_DISCOUNT` onto `SalesAdjustmentDraft` with `scope: 'line'`. That mapping does not work against the `sales` module as implemented:

- `SalesAdjustmentDraft` (`packages/core/src/modules/sales/lib/types.ts`) has no line reference at all. `scope: 'line'` is accepted, but nothing on the draft says *which* line.
- The persisted entities do have one — `SalesOrderAdjustment.order_line_id` and `SalesQuoteAdjustment.quote_line_id` — so the schema was never the obstacle.
- The command path closes the gap in the other direction: `createAdjustmentDraftFromInput` in `packages/core/src/modules/sales/commands/documents.ts` throws `400 "Line-scoped adjustments are not supported yet."` when a line-scoped adjustment arrives *with* a line reference.

So the §A.5 mapping either fails with a 400 or succeeds having silently detached the discount from its line. Neither is acceptable for a per-line, let alone per-unit, promotion.

**Resolution.** Promotion effects split by target rather than travelling as one kind:

| Effect | Carried as |
|--------|-----------|
| `LINE_DISCOUNT` (`appliesTo: 'line'` or `'unit'`) | `SalesLineSnapshot.discountAmount` on the matching line, as a **per-unit** amount: `\|amount\| / lineQuantity` |
| `CART_DISCOUNT`, `DELIVERY_DISCOUNT` (`appliesTo: 'order'`) | `SalesAdjustmentDraft` with `scope: 'order'` — unchanged from §A.5 |
| `ADD_FREE_ITEM` | A new zero-price line, unchanged from §A.5 |

Three rules bind `cart` here, each of them a mispriced order if broken. **Their normative home is the `cart` module spec (§3, rev 4), not this document** — they constrain `cart`'s implementation, and a promotions amendment does not get to legislate another module's code any more than it gets to legislate `sales`'s (§B.7). They are restated here because §A.5 put the broken mapping in this document and a reader of §A.5 must find the correction:

1. **`discountAmount` is per-unit over the line's FULL quantity — assign `|amount| / lineQuantity`, never `unitAmount` and never `amount`.** There is no basis flag to choose: `buildBaseLineResult` (`packages/core/src/modules/sales/lib/calculations.ts:80-123`) reads `SalesLineSnapshot.discountAmount` as `discountPerUnit` and computes `min(max(discountPerUnit × quantity, 0), netSubtotalBeforeDiscount)` — unconditionally, for every document kind. Divide by `lineQuantity`, not `appliedQuantity`: a benefit covering 5 of 8 units at −2.40 has `amount: "-12.00"`, so `discountAmount = 12.00 / 8 = 1.50` and `sales` reproduces `1.50 × 8 = 12.00`. ✅ The two plausible mistakes both overcharge the merchant: assigning `unitAmount` (2.40) yields `2.40 × 8 = 19.20`, and assigning the total `amount` (12.00) yields `12.00 × 8 = 96.00` — eight times the intended discount. On TC-PROM-065(a)'s figures (10 units at 20.00 net, `amount: "-40.00"`) the second mistake gives `40.00 × 10 = 400.00` against a 200.00 line, where `min(400.00, 200.00)` clamps it to the **entire line free**. The one rule is correct for full and partial coverage alike, so it is unconditional.<br><br>Residual, worth stating: the division is exact only when `lineQuantity` divides the total. `round()` is 4 dp (`calculations.ts:22-24`), matching `numeric(18,4)`, so 10.00 across 3 units gives `3.3333 × 3 = 9.9999` — 0.0001 short of the effect's stated `amount`. Sub-cent, but `cart` §14's Phase 2 gate asserts *byte-identical* totals against the `SalesOrder`, so that gate must name the document total as authoritative and treat the effect's `amount` as the display figure.
2. **`discountAmount` is a positive magnitude on a net basis.** `sales` subtracts it from `unitPriceNet × quantity`. Effects are negative decimal strings, and `basis` may be `'gross'` when `CartContext.taxMode` is `'gross'` (§A.5). `cart` takes the absolute value, and converts a gross-basis amount to net before assigning it — a gross amount assigned unconverted is A-R1 reappearing through a different field.
3. **Sum, then record.** `SalesLineSnapshot.discountAmount` is one scalar per line. Several cumulative promotions discounting the same line sum into it; per-promotion attribution does not survive the mapping.

The cost of (3) is stated plainly because it is real: a promoted line shows its discount in the total but not which campaigns produced it, so the per-promotion audit trail lives only in `PromotionUsage.effects_snapshot`, which §*Promotion Usage Lifecycle* already writes at order confirmation. The clamp in `sales` (`Math.min(discountTotal, netSubtotalBeforeDiscount)`) also means a discount exceeding the line silently truncates rather than erroring; promotions must not rely on it as a guard, and `max_discount` remains the intended bound.

### B.7 What is deliberately not fixed here

Giving `SalesAdjustmentDraft` a `lineId` and teaching `documents.ts` to persist line-attributed adjustments is the better long-term answer: it would restore per-promotion attribution on the line and light up the `order_line_id` column that already exists. It is **out of scope for this amendment** and belongs in its own spec against the `sales` module, for a reason of blast radius rather than difficulty — `sales` is shipped code with live orders, quotes and returns reading these drafts, whereas `promotions` and `cart` are both greenfield. A change to a shipped module's calculation contract should not ride along inside a promotions amendment.

Until that spec exists, §B.6 is the mapping. It is a contraction of ambition, not a workaround with a hidden failure mode: totals are correct, caps are honoured, and the only loss is per-promotion attribution on the line, which is recorded elsewhere.

### B.8 Risks added

| # | Risk | Severity | Failure scenario | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A-R6 | Cap discarded by the per-unit mapping | **High** | `sales` multiplies `SalesLineSnapshot.discountAmount` by the line's full quantity, so a capped effect mapped with either of the two natural-looking values overcharges the merchant and nothing errors: `unitAmount` (−2.40) discounts 8 units where the benefit allowed 5 (19.20 instead of 12.00), and the effect's total `amount` (−12.00) yields 96.00 — eight times the intended discount, and enough to hit the clamp and zero the line once `\|amount\| × lineQuantity` exceeds its subtotal. | `discountAmount = \|amount\| / lineQuantity`, unconditionally (B.6 rule 1); `TC-PROM-060` asserts the partially covered line's document total in all three directions, so either mistake fails the suite | Low |
| A-R7 | Ambiguous cap ordering | Medium | An operator caps at 5 pieces without stating which 5; the engine picks, and a campaign costed against the cheapest units is billed against the most expensive. | `selector` required whenever a cap is set, rejected at the write path, and unreachable in the admin form (B.4) | Low |
| A-R8 | Cap loosened by line splitting | Medium | A cap counted per line is defeated by splitting a purchase across lines — which configurable products do on their own, without the buyer intending it. | Cart-wide budget held in `resolveEffects` (B.3), tested against a multi-line cart of one SKU (`TC-PROM-059`) | Low |

### B.9 Additional test cases

- `TC-PROM-058` — `max_quantity: 5` with `selector: cart_order` on an 8-unit line under `applies_to: 'unit'` returns one effect with `appliedQuantity: 5`, `lineQuantity: 8`, and `amount === unitAmount × 5`
- `TC-PROM-059` — The same benefit against three lines of the same SKU at four units each discounts five units **in total** across lines, not five per line (A-R8)
- `TC-PROM-060` — A partially covered line mapped through `cart` produces a document total equal to `unitPriceNet × quantity − |amount|`. Asserted in all three directions so neither mis-mapping can pass unnoticed (A-R6): with `discountAmount = |amount| / lineQuantity` the total matches; with `unitAmount` assigned directly it is over-discounted by `lineQuantity / appliedQuantity`; with the raw `amount` assigned it is over-discounted by `lineQuantity`. Concretely — 8 units at 25.00 net (200.00), effect `amount: "-12.00"`, `unitAmount: "-2.40"`, `appliedQuantity: 5` — the expected total is 188.00, and the two wrong mappings give 180.80 and 104.00. **Owned by the `cart` module's suite** — it exercises `cart`'s mapping and `sales`'s arithmetic, not the promotions engine; listed here so A-R6 has a visible mitigation
- `TC-PROM-061` — `applies_to: 'line'` with `max_quantity: 5` against a single 8-unit line applies **nothing** — a line cannot be split under that target
- `TC-PROM-062` — A benefit config with `max_quantity` and no `selector` is rejected 422 at the write path (A-R7); `selector: all` with a cap is rejected likewise
- `TC-PROM-063` — `quantity_step: 3` with `max_quantity: 5` discounts 3 units, not 5: a remainder smaller than a whole block is not discounted
- `TC-PROM-064` — Determinism, tested at the level where it is observable: a unit test on `selectUnits` asserts that two calls with the same benefit and cart return the same `UnitSelection` — same lines, same order, same `appliedQuantity` per line — including when two lines tie on unit price. The evaluation-level assertion is the weaker "two evaluations return identical effects"; *which* units were selected is not recoverable from the effect payload by design (§B.5), so it must be asserted against the helper, not the response
- `TC-PROM-065` — `max_quantity` and `max_discount` compose, with concrete figures in both directions. Cart: one line, 10 units at 20.00 net, benefit `value: "50%"`, `applies_to: 'unit'`, `selector: cart_order`. (a) `max_quantity: 4`, `max_discount: "100"` → the quantity cap binds first: `appliedQuantity: 4`, `unitAmount: "-10.00"`, `amount: "-40.00"`. (b) `max_quantity: 8`, `max_discount: "50"` → the money cap binds: `appliedQuantity: 8`, `amount: "-50.00"` (capped from −80.00) and `unitAmount: "-6.25"` back-solved, **not** `"-10.00"` (the C2 identity, §Invariants)
- `TC-PROM-070` — `max_lines: 2` against a cart of four qualifying lines discounts exactly two lines, chosen by `selector`, with `max_quantity` unset; and `max_lines: 2` combined with `max_quantity: 5` stops at whichever binds first
- `TC-PROM-071` — Every write-path rejection in the §Data Models rejection table returns 422: a cap on an `order`-target benefit, `selector: nth` with `max_quantity`, `nth` without `nth_position`, `nth_position` without `nth`, and `quantity_step` under `applies_to: 'line'`
- `TC-PROM-072` — A `buy_x_get_y` whose final application cannot be funded in full by the remaining `max_quantity` budget grants that application **not at all** rather than pro-rating it (§B.3)
- `TC-PROM-066` — A gross-basis effect (`CartContext.taxMode: 'gross'`) is converted to net before assignment to `discountAmount` (B.6 rule 2). The cart-equals-order totals assertion is `TC-PROM-052`'s and is not repeated here
- `TC-PROM-067` — The `applies_to` allow-list is enforced, not merely documented: `cart_discount` with `applies_to: 'unit'` and `product_discount` with `applies_to: 'order'` are both rejected 422 at the write path. The same check runs for an extension benefit type against its declared `supportedAppliesTo`, reading only the registry entry and never the extension's `config` (B.2)
- `TC-PROM-068` — Two cumulative promotions discounting the same line sum into that line's single `discountAmount`, and both remain individually recoverable from `PromotionUsage.effects_snapshot` after order confirmation (B.6 rule 3)
- `TC-PROM-069` — A `buy_x_get_y` benefit with a 100%-off reward emits `ADD_FREE_ITEM` rather than a `LINE_DISCOUNT`, whatever its `applies_to`, and the inserted line is excluded from the next evaluation's eligibility (B.2, reinforcing `TC-PROM-053`)

### B.10 Market reference

The shape follows the consensus of the established engines rather than inventing one. Magento 2 cart price rules carry `discount_qty` ("Maximum Qty Discount is Applied To") and `discount_step` ("Discount Qty Step") as first-class columns beside the action type — `max_quantity` and `quantity_step` are those fields under project naming. Shopify's discount API separates the allocation method (`ACROSS` the order vs `EACH` entitled item) from the entitled quantity, which is the `applies_to` / `max_quantity` split. Medusa carries the same distinction as `allocation: 'total' | 'item'`.

The one place this spec diverges is Sylius, whose unit-level actions attach an adjustment to every `OrderItemUnit` individually. That is the most faithful model for partial returns, and it is rejected here for the reason in B.5: it would break an existing invariant and fan a large B2B line out into hundreds of effects per evaluation. `appliedQuantity` on a single effect preserves what the fan-out was for — knowing how many units were covered — at a fraction of the payload.

## Changelog

| Date | Version | Summary |
|------|---------|---------|
| 2026-02-23 | 1.0.0 | Initial spec — domain model, three-pass evaluation engine, cart API, admin UI, code system, 4-phase implementation plan |

Aligns with `condition_expression` pattern in `business_rules` and `workflows`. Normalization step now maps rows directly to `{ type, config }` shape. Config per type validated by Zod discriminated union. |
| 2026-02-24 | 1.2.0 | Add extensibility architecture: server-side `PromotionExtensionRegistry` (custom rule types, custom benefit types, evaluation middleware `beforeEvaluate`/`afterResolve`, code middleware `beforeCodeUse`/`afterCodeUse`); client-side `promotionExtensionConfiguratorRegistry` for custom tree-builder UI components; `GET /api/promotions/extension-types` endpoint; `context.extensions` field on `CartContext`; 5 declared widget injection slots; Phase 5 implementation plan and TC-PROM-040–045 test cases; new events `evaluation.completed`, `code.exhausted`, `promotion.expiring-soon`. |
| 2026-02-24 | 1.3.0 | Add `max_discount` optional field to `product_discount`, `cart_discount`, `buy_x_get_y`, and `tiered_discount` benefit configs. Effect resolvers in `lib/effect-resolvers.ts` cap the computed amount at `max_discount` after the raw calculation. New invariant: cap is per-benefit, expressed in operating currency. Added `TC-PROM-014` test case. |
| 2026-08-14 | 2.0.0 | **Amendment for the `cart` module** (see §Amendment, normative over *Cart-Facing Endpoints*). Primary integration becomes DI `promotionsService`; HTTP endpoints retained as an adapter for external carts. Cart-facing routes move from `/api/cart/*` to `/api/promotions/*` to resolve a namespace collision with the `cart` module. `CartContext.items[]` gains `productId`, `variantId`, `cartLineId`; effect targeting gains `targetCartLineId` alongside `targetSku`. `CartContext` gains `customerGroupIds`, `taxMode`, `storeId`; new built-in `customer_group` rule type enables B2B group-scoped promotions. Effects gain a required `basis: 'net' \| 'gross'` so `salesCalculationService` does not tax an already-taxed discount. `ADD_FREE_ITEM` lines are excluded from subsequent eligibility to prevent a buy-X-get-Y feedback loop. `CodeReservation` gains `cart_id` with a lifecycle tied to cart abandonment and expiry. Single evaluation per batch mutation, with a P95 latency budget. Risks A-R1…A-R5 and cases TC-PROM-050…057 added. |
| 2026-02-26 | 1.4.0 | Add `PromotionUsage` entity (`promotion_usages` table) serving as per-order compliance audit ledger and global spend tracker. Add `PromotionUsageService` (`lib/promotion-usage-service.ts`) with `registerUsage` (serializable budget cap enforcement, idempotent upsert, 207 Multi-Status on budget block), `revertUsage` (soft-revert on order cancellation), and `getBudgetConsumed`. Add `POST /api/cart/register-usage` and `POST /api/cart/revert-usage` cart-facing endpoints. Add `eligible_currencies` (text[]) + `max_budget` (numeric nullable) + `budget_currency` (text nullable) to `Promotion`. Add `currency` (required) to `CartContext`. Add currency eligibility check and optimistic budget pre-check to evaluation engine. Update `NormalizedPromotion` shape with `eligibleCurrencies`, `maxBudget`, `budgetCurrency`, `totalDiscountGranted`. Update cache build to aggregate `totalDiscountGranted` from usage table. Add `promotions.usage.registered`, `promotions.usage.reverted`, `promotions.promotion.budget-exhausted` events. Add `TC-PROM-023`–`TC-PROM-026` test cases. Add Budget Cap Race Window risk entry. |
| 2026-08-17 | 2.0.1 | **Amendment reconciliation fix.** §A.3's route-rename table was incomplete and partly wrong: it listed a route (`remove-code`) that does not exist anywhere in this document — the real route is `delete-code` — and omitted `validate-code`/`use-code` entirely, which would have left both under the colliding `/api/cart/*` namespace the amendment exists to resolve. This table entry (1.4.0, dated *before* the 2.0.0 amendment but positioned after it) had also re-added `POST /api/cart/register-usage`/`revert-usage` under the pre-amendment namespace without reconciling against §A.3. Corrected §A.3 to cover all seven cart-facing routes; updated the module file structure, every *API Contracts* route header, and the Phase 3 implementation-plan steps to the `/api/promotions/*` paths. No further behavioural change. |
| 2026-08-17 | 2.0.2 | **`/om-pre-implement-spec` audit fixes.** (1) The 2.0.1 fix was itself incomplete: 8 further `/api/cart/*`/old-operation-name references remained in the Proposed Solution summary, the Evaluation Engine Data Flow / Code Lifecycle / Promotion Usage Lifecycle diagrams, the Extensibility section (twice), the Phase 5 plan step, and a Risk scenario — all now updated. (2) `PromotionsService` (§A.2) was missing `validateCode`/`useCode` — two of the seven renamed routes had no in-process method, contradicting the "in-process callers MUST use the service" rule for those two operations; added. (3) Added §A.2a stating `reserveCode`/`releaseCode`/`useCode`/`registerUsage`/`revertUsage` are registered commands, not bare service calls, per root `AGENTS.md`. (4) Added §A.2b declaring `cart → promotions` a hard dependency, not an optional `tryResolve` peer. (5) Added a Final Compliance Report addendum for all of the above. See `ANALYSIS-2026-02-23-spec-055-promotions-cart-amendment.md` for the full audit. |
| 2026-09-07 | 2.1.0 | **Benefit application target and quantity caps** (see §Amendment — 2026-09-07, normative over *Data Models — Benefit*, *Resolved Effect Types* and the `LINE_DISCOUNT` row of §A.5; the affected body tables are updated in place). `Benefit` gains an `applies_to` column (`order` \| `line` \| `unit`) with a per-type allow-list, replacing the implied-by-`benefit_type` target, `tiered_discount.scope` and the undefined `delivery_discount.scope`. A shared quantity-cap block (`max_quantity`, `max_lines`, `quantity_step`) intersected into every benefit variant replaces `product_discount.pcs_limit`; counting is **cart-wide per benefit invocation**, held in Pass 3 because the budget spans lines. `selector` gains `cart_order` (the literal "first N") and becomes **required whenever a cap is set** — no default, since "first 5" and "5 most expensive" are different campaign costs. `LINE_DISCOUNT` gains `appliesTo`, `lineQuantity`, `appliedQuantity` and `unitAmount`; a partially covered line stays one effect rather than fanning out per unit. §B.6 supersedes §A.5's line mapping: `sales` rejects a line-attributed adjustment draft today (`documents.ts` — *"Line-scoped adjustments are not supported yet."*) and `SalesAdjustmentDraft` carries no line reference, so line effects travel on `SalesLineSnapshot.discountAmount`, which `sales` reads as a **per-unit** amount and multiplies by the line's full quantity — `cart` therefore assigns `\|amount\| / lineQuantity`, never `unitAmount` and never the raw `amount`. Extending `sales` with line-attributed adjustments is deferred to its own spec (§B.7). `NormalizedBenefit` gains `appliesTo`; `BenefitExtension` gains `supportedAppliesTo`/`defaultAppliesTo` and receives a pre-budgeted `UnitSelection`. New `lib/unit-selection.ts`. Risks A-R6…A-R8 and cases TC-PROM-058…072 added. `BenefitExtension` also declares `capsHonoured`, and `GET /api/promotions/extension-types` surfaces it alongside the applies-to metadata. |
| 2026-09-09 | 2.1.1 | **§B.6 rule 1 corrected — it was specified against a `sales` API that does not exist.** 2.1.0 mandated `discountAmountBasis: 'line'` and attributed the behaviour to `resolveLineDiscountTotal` in `sales/lib/calculations.ts`. Neither identifier occurs anywhere in the repository: `SalesLineSnapshot` (`packages/core/src/modules/sales/lib/types.ts:35-63`) has no basis field, and `buildBaseLineResult` (`calculations.ts:80-123`) reads `discountAmount` as `discountPerUnit` and multiplies by the line's **full** `quantity` unconditionally — the one basis 2.1.0 forbade, with no opt-out. Followed as written, `cart` would have assigned the effect's total and discounted it `lineQuantity` times over; on this amendment's own TC-PROM-065(a) figures the clamp then takes a 200.00 line to zero against an intended 40.00 discount. Rule 1 now states the real contract — `discountAmount = \|amount\| / lineQuantity`, the line's full quantity rather than `appliedQuantity`, never `unitAmount` and never the raw `amount` — plus the sub-cent residual where the division is inexact (`round()` is 4 dp, `calculations.ts:22-24`). A-R6's mechanism restated around the two real mis-mappings instead of a fictional basis flag; `TC-PROM-060` widened from two directions to three with worked figures; the §B.6 mapping table and the 2.1.0 changelog row corrected to match. §B.7's deferral is unaffected. |
