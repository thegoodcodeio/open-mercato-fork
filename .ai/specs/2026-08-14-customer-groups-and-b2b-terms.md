## TLDR

**Key Points:**
- `customer_group_id` is consumed today by `catalog/lib/pricing.ts` (specificity score +3), `catalog/api/prices`, `catalog/commands/prices.ts`, `catalog` AI price tooling and `sales.SalesTaxRate` — **with no table behind it anywhere in the repo**. This spec gives it an owner.
- A new `customer_groups` module introduces `CustomerGroup`, time-bounded `CustomerGroupMembership`, and group-level commercial terms (price kind, tax display mode, payment terms, credit limit, approval threshold).
- Credit is a **ledger, not a counter**: `CustomerCreditAccount` holds the limit, `CustomerCreditLedgerEntry` is append-only, and exposure is derived. Concurrent purchase-on-account checkouts cannot jointly overshoot the limit.
- No FK constraint is added to `catalog_product_prices.customer_group_id` or `sales_tax_rates.customer_group_id` in this release. Existing rows carrying arbitrary UUIDs keep resolving exactly as they do today; a reconciliation report surfaces orphans instead of a migration breaking them.

**Scope:**
- `CustomerGroup`, `CustomerGroupMembership`, `CustomerGroupTerms`, `CustomerCreditAccount`, `CustomerCreditLedgerEntry`, `CustomerPurchaseApproval`
- `customerGroupsService` DI contract: group resolution, terms resolution, credit reservation/settlement
- Admin CRUD for groups, membership, terms and credit; group pickers in `catalog` price rows and `sales` tax rates replacing the current free-text UUID
- Orphan reconciliation report and CLI

**Concerns:**
- Credit reservation must be serializable or concurrent checkouts overshoot the limit — the same class of race SPEC-055 documents for promotion budget caps, with a worse consequence (unsecured trade credit)
- Group membership is time-bounded, which means price resolution becomes time-dependent; cached prices must not outlive a membership boundary
- Overlapping memberships are legitimate (a customer can be in "Wholesale" and "Q3 Promo Tier"), so every consumer must handle a **set** of group ids, while `catalog` and `sales` today match a **single** `customer_group_id` column

---

## 1) Overview

This is the first spec of the ecommerce suite and a hard prerequisite for the rest of it. Every B2B behaviour downstream — contract pricing, group tax treatment, restricted assortment, purchase on account, buyer approvals — resolves through a customer group id that currently has no owning table.

The module is deliberately narrow. It owns *who belongs to which commercial group and on what terms they buy*. It does not own price rows (`catalog`), tax rates (`sales`), promotions (`promotions`) or identity (`customers`, `customer_accounts`).

---

## 2) Problem Statement

### 2.1 The dangling column

`customer_group_id` appears across the codebase as a plain nullable UUID with no referential integrity and no way for an operator to discover valid values:

| Consumer | File | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Price specificity scoring | `catalog/lib/pricing.ts:66,84` | `if (row.customerGroupId && ctx.customerGroupId !== row.customerGroupId) return false`; matching row scores +3 |
| Price rows | `catalog/data/entities.ts` (`CatalogProductPrice.customerGroupId`) | Stored, never validated |
| Price API | `catalog/api/prices/route.ts` | Accepted as a filter and a write field |
| Price commands | `catalog/commands/prices.ts`, `catalog/commands/variants.ts` | Written through to price rows |
| AI price tooling | `catalog/ai-tools/prices-offers-pack.ts` | Exposed to an LLM as a settable field |
| Tax rates | `sales/data/entities.ts` (`SalesTaxRate.customerGroupId`) | Participates in priority-based tax resolution |

An operator wanting wholesale pricing today must invent a UUID, paste it into every relevant price row, and remember it. Nothing lists the groups that exist, nothing prevents a typo, and a typo silently means "this price never applies" rather than an error.

### 2.2 Missing B2B commercial terms

Beyond grouping, B2B selling needs terms that have no home:

- **Tax display mode** — B2B buyers expect net prices, B2C gross. `CatalogPriceKind.displayMode` sets this per price kind, not per buyer.
- **Payment terms** — `CustomerCompanyBilling.paymentTerms` exists as free text on the company profile, unused by any commerce path.
- **Credit limit and exposure** — nothing anywhere. Purchase on account cannot be gated.
- **Approval thresholds** — a junior buyer placing a 200 000 PLN order should route to an approver. `CustomerEntityRole` models roles on a customer entity but carries no purchase authority.

### 2.3 Single-value matching vs. real membership

`catalog` and `sales` each match one `customer_group_id` per row against one context value. Real customers belong to several commercial groups at once — a base tier plus a campaign tier plus a contract. The single-column shape on the *rule* side is fine and stays; the *context* side must become a set, and specificity scoring must define which of several matching groups wins.

---

## 3) Proposed Solution

A `customer_groups` module in `packages/core/src/modules/customer_groups/` owning six entities, one DI service, admin CRUD, and a reconciliation report. Consumers change only in that they resolve a **set** of group ids from the service instead of receiving a single opaque value from the caller.

### 3.1 Resolution model

```
CustomerEntity (customers)
      │
      │ CustomerGroupMembership  (time-bounded, many-to-many)
      ▼
CustomerGroup  ──── CustomerGroupTerms (1:1, commercial terms)
      │
      │ consumed as a SET of ids by:
      ├──► catalog pricing        (row.customerGroupId ∈ ctx.customerGroupIds)
      ├──► sales tax resolution   (row.customerGroupId ∈ ctx.customerGroupIds)
      ├──► promotions rules       (CustomerGroupRule)
      ├──► ecommerce assortment   (channel binding scope)
      └──► cart / checkout        (terms, credit, approval)
```

### 3.2 Group precedence

When several of a customer's groups match a rule row, the winner is the group with the highest `priority` (integer, descending), ties broken by the most recently created membership. `priority` is authored by the operator, is unique within a tenant, and is shown in the admin list so precedence is never implicit.

This rule is stated once here and referenced by every consumer. Consumers MUST NOT invent their own tie-breaking.

---

## 4) Architecture

### 4.1 Ownership boundaries

| Owns | Does not own |
|---|---|
| Group definition, hierarchy, priority | Price rows — `catalog` |
| Membership and its validity window | Tax rates — `sales` |
| Commercial terms attached to a group | Promotion rules — `promotions` |
| Credit limit, ledger and exposure | Payment execution — `payment_gateways` |
| Purchase approval policy and requests | Identity and authentication — `customers`, `customer_accounts` |

### 4.2 Dependency direction

`customer_groups` depends on `customers` by FK id only (`CustomerEntity.id`), resolved through the query engine. `catalog`, `sales`, `cart`, `checkout`, `promotions` and `ecommerce` depend on `customer_groups` through `customerGroupsService` in DI. `customer_groups` MUST NOT import from any of them.

### 4.3 Why credit is a ledger

A `credit_used` counter updated in place has two failure modes that a ledger does not: concurrent updates lost to last-write-wins, and no audit trail when a dispute arises about why a customer was blocked. The ledger is append-only, exposure is `SUM(amount)` over open entries, and the limit check plus the reserve entry happen in one serializable transaction. This mirrors the approach SPEC-055 specifies for promotion budget caps, where the same race exists with lower stakes.

---

## 5) Data Models

All entities carry `id` (UUID PK), `tenant_id`, `organization_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at` unless noted.

### 5.1 `CustomerGroup` (`customer_groups`)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | text | Unique within tenant; stable identifier used in imports and rules |
| `name` | text | Display name |
| `description` | text, nullable | |
| `kind` | text | `b2c \| b2b \| internal \| partner` |
| `parent_id` | uuid, nullable | FK → `customer_groups`; membership in a child implies the ancestors |
| `priority` | integer | Precedence per §3.2; unique within tenant |
| `is_default` | boolean | At most one per tenant; assigned to customers with no explicit membership |
| `is_active` | boolean | Inactive groups are excluded from resolution but retain history |
| `metadata` | jsonb, nullable | |

Constraints: unique `(tenant_id, code)`; unique `(tenant_id, priority)`; at most one `is_default = true` per tenant; `parent_id` must not form a cycle (enforced in the command, depth capped at 5).

### 5.2 `CustomerGroupMembership` (`customer_group_memberships`)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `group_id` | uuid | FK → `customer_groups` |
| `customer_id` | uuid | `customers.CustomerEntity.id` — FK id only, no ORM relation |
| `source` | text | `manual \| import \| rule \| onboarding` |
| `valid_from` | timestamptz, nullable | null = always |
| `valid_until` | timestamptz, nullable | null = indefinite |
| `assigned_by_user_id` | uuid, nullable | Audit |
| `notes` | text, nullable | |

Constraints: unique `(tenant_id, group_id, customer_id)` among rows with `deleted_at IS NULL`. Overlapping memberships in *different* groups are legitimate and expected.

Index: `(tenant_id, customer_id, valid_from, valid_until)` — this is the hot path for buyer-context resolution.

### 5.3 `CustomerGroupTerms` (`customer_group_terms`)

One row per group. Absent row means "inherit from parent group, then tenant defaults".

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `group_id` | uuid | FK → `customer_groups`, unique |
| `price_kind_id` | uuid, nullable | `catalog.CatalogPriceKind.id` — the price kind this group buys at; its own `displayMode` (`including-tax` \| `excluding-tax`) is the **only** source of gross/net display for this group — see §6.1a. No separate `tax_display_mode` column: a `/om-pre-implement-spec` audit found the original draft stored gross/net twice (here, independently of `price_kind_id`), with no reconciliation rule and no codebase precedent for a buyer-level tax preference independent of the selected price kind (`catalog`'s own `LineItemDialog.tsx` derives mode from `displayMode` 1:1 everywhere). |
| `payment_terms_days` | integer, nullable | Net days; `0` = prepayment |
| `allow_purchase_on_account` | boolean | Default `false` |
| `default_credit_limit` | numeric(16,2), nullable | Applied to new credit accounts in this group |
| `credit_currency_code` | text, nullable | |
| `approval_required_above` | numeric(16,2), nullable | Order gross above this routes to approval; null = never |
| `min_order_value` | numeric(16,2), nullable | Rejected below this at checkout |
| `assortment_scope` | jsonb, nullable | `AssortmentScope \| null` — `{ categoryIds?, tagIds?, excludeProductIds?, excludeCategoryIds?, excludeTagIds? }`, the shared type from `packages/shared/src/lib/catalog-visibility/` ([Buyer-Scoped Catalog Visibility](./2026-08-21-buyer-scoped-catalog-visibility.md) §3.3). Same shape as the channel binding scope. `excludeCategoryIds`/`excludeTagIds` added 2026-09-06 for symmetry with `excludeProductIds`; additive jsonb keys, no migration. Resolved by `resolveAssortmentScope()`, **not** by `resolveTerms()` — §6.4 |
| `metadata` | jsonb, nullable | |

### 5.4 `CustomerCreditAccount` (`customer_credit_accounts`)

One row per customer per currency. Overrides the group default.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `customer_id` | uuid | `customers.CustomerEntity.id` |
| `currency_code` | text | |
| `credit_limit` | numeric(16,2) | Authoritative limit |
| `is_on_hold` | boolean | Manual block; blocks regardless of exposure |
| `hold_reason` | text, nullable | |
| `updated_by_user_id` | uuid, nullable | Audit |

Optimistic locking uses the platform's standard `updated_at` mechanism (already present per the §5 header), not a `version` counter — this entity is `CrudForm`-edited, so the header is auto-derived from `initialValues.updatedAt`; see the Concurrency Strategy subsection below. No separate `version` column.

Constraint: unique `(tenant_id, customer_id, currency_code)`.

### 5.5 `CustomerCreditLedgerEntry` (`customer_credit_ledger_entries`)

Append-only. No `updated_at`, no `deleted_at`; corrections are compensating entries.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `credit_account_id` | uuid | FK → `customer_credit_accounts` |
| `entry_type` | text | `reserve \| release \| settle \| adjust` |
| `amount` | numeric(16,2) | Signed; `reserve` positive, `release`/`settle` negative, `adjust` either |
| `source_type` | text | `checkout \| order \| invoice \| payment \| manual` |
| `source_id` | uuid, nullable | |
| `idempotency_key` | text, nullable | Unique per account; makes retried reservations safe |
| `balance_after` | numeric(16,2) | Denormalized running exposure at write time, for audit reconstruction |
| `created_by_user_id` | uuid, nullable | |
| `note` | text, nullable | |

Constraints: unique `(credit_account_id, idempotency_key)` where the key is non-null. Index `(tenant_id, credit_account_id, created_at)`.

**Exposure** = `SUM(amount)` over the account's entries. `balance_after` is written for audit only and MUST NOT be read as the source of truth.

### 5.6 `CustomerPurchaseApproval` (`customer_purchase_approvals`)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `customer_id` | uuid | |
| `requested_by_customer_user_id` | uuid | `customer_accounts.CustomerUser.id` |
| `subject_type` | text | `cart \| checkout_session \| quote` |
| `subject_id` | uuid | |
| `amount_gross` | numeric(16,2) | Snapshot at request time |
| `currency_code` | text | |
| `status` | text | `pending \| approved \| rejected \| expired \| withdrawn` |
| `decided_by_customer_user_id` | uuid, nullable | |
| `decided_at` | timestamptz, nullable | |
| `decision_note` | text, nullable | |
| `expires_at` | timestamptz | |

Optimistic locking on the decide action uses `updated_at` (already present per the §5 header), not a `version` counter: `POST /approvals/:id/decide` is a non-`makeCrudRoute` command endpoint, so it wraps its write with `enforceCommandOptimisticLock` reading the `updated_at`-derived header the client sent with the approval snapshot it decided against, and surfaces a conflict via `surfaceRecordConflict` if a second approver's decision lands first — this is what actually protects R8 ("approval double-decision"); a plain `version` integer with nothing reading or incrementing it would not. No separate `version` column.

Approver identification reuses `customers.CustomerEntityRole` (`roleType = 'purchase_approver'`) rather than introducing a parallel role model.

### 5.7 `CustomerAssortmentOverride` (`customer_assortment_overrides`) — added 2026-09-16

One **optional** row per customer, carrying a catalog-visibility rule that applies to that customer alone, above and below whatever their groups grant. Absent row — the common case — means "this customer's assortment comes entirely from their groups," and resolves to a value byte-identical to the group-only result, which is what keeps that buyer sharing storefront cache entries with their group peers ([Buyer-Scoped Catalog Visibility](./2026-08-21-buyer-scoped-catalog-visibility.md) §3.7).

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `customer_id` | uuid | `customers.CustomerEntity.id` — FK id only, no ORM relation, same convention as §5.2 |
| `grant_scope` | jsonb, nullable | `AssortmentScope \| null` — the **widening** direction: joins the buyer's OR-list as one more branch, exactly like an additional group grant |
| `restrict_scope` | jsonb, nullable | `AssortmentScope \| null` — the **narrowing** direction: intersected over *every* branch, so it also cuts what the customer's groups grant |
| `valid_from` | timestamptz, nullable | null = always; same window semantics as a membership (§5.2) |
| `valid_until` | timestamptz, nullable | null = indefinite |
| `notes` | text, nullable | Why this account has a bespoke assortment — the first question support asks |
| `metadata` | jsonb, nullable | |

Constraints: unique `(tenant_id, customer_id)` among rows with `deleted_at IS NULL`. That unique partial index also serves the cached `EXISTS` probe the storefront uses to decide whether this buyer diverges from their group at all.

Declared as an **entity extension** of the customer, not as columns on `CustomerEntity`, per root `AGENTS.md`'s rule for extending another module's data — `customer_groups/data/extensions.ts` links `customers:customer_entity` → `customer_groups:customer_assortment_override` on `id` ↔ `customer_id`, `one-to-one`. Both scopes and the two-direction algebra are specified in the visibility spec §3.6/§4.4; this module owns the table because it already owns `resolveAssortmentScope()` and already owns validity-windowed buyer rows with exactly these semantics.

## 6) Service Contract

Registered in `customer_groups/di.ts` as `customerGroupsService`.

```typescript
type GroupResolution = {
  groupIds: string[]              // ordered by priority desc — the winner is groupIds[0]
  groups: Array<{ id: string; code: string; name: string; kind: string; priority: number }>
}

type ResolvedTerms = {
  priceKindId: string | null   // gross/net display is derived downstream from this price kind's own `displayMode` — see §6.1a; ResolvedTerms does not carry a separate tax-mode field
  paymentTermsDays: number | null
  allowPurchaseOnAccount: boolean
  approvalRequiredAbove: number | null
  minOrderValue: number | null
  sourceGroupId: string | null    // which group each value came from, for admin explainability
  // NOTE: no `assortmentScope` field — withdrawn 2026-09-06, see §6.4. Assortment scope is a
  // visibility grant, not a scalar term, so it cannot follow §6.1's highest-priority-wins rule.
}

type CreditCheck = {
  allowed: boolean
  reason: 'ok' | 'on_hold' | 'limit_exceeded' | 'no_account' | 'not_permitted'
  creditLimit: number
  exposure: number
  available: number
  currencyCode: string
}

interface CustomerGroupsService {
  resolveGroups(input: { customerId: string | null; at?: Date }): Promise<GroupResolution>

  resolveTerms(input: { customerId: string | null; groupIds?: string[] }): Promise<ResolvedTerms>

  // Assortment scope resolves separately from the scalar terms above — §6.4.
  resolveAssortmentScope(input: { customerId: string | null; at?: Date }): Promise<{
    scope: EffectiveAssortmentScope   // groups unioned, the customer's own grant unioned in and its restriction intersected over the result (§6.4); nothing matching → null (unrestricted)
    sourceGroupIds: string[]          // every group that contributed, for the explain-terms panel
    sourceCustomerOverrideId: string | null   // the customer's own §5.7 row, or null — the common case
  }>

  checkCredit(input: {
    customerId: string
    currencyCode: string
    amount: number
  }): Promise<CreditCheck>

  // Serializable transaction: re-checks the limit and appends the reserve entry atomically.
  reserveCredit(input: {
    customerId: string
    currencyCode: string
    amount: number
    sourceType: 'checkout' | 'order'
    sourceId: string
    idempotencyKey: string
  }): Promise<{ reserved: boolean; entryId: string | null; check: CreditCheck }>

  releaseCredit(input: { idempotencyKey: string; reason: string }): Promise<void>

  settleCredit(input: {
    customerId: string; currencyCode: string; amount: number
    sourceType: 'invoice' | 'payment'; sourceId: string; idempotencyKey: string
  }): Promise<void>
}
```

### 6.1 Terms inheritance

`resolveTerms` walks, per field independently: highest-priority group with a non-null value → its ancestors → tenant default. Each field records its `sourceGroupId` so the admin UI can explain *why* a buyer got a given term — the single most common B2B support question.

### 6.1a Tax display mode is derived, not stored (fixed 2026-08-17)

An earlier draft gave `CustomerGroupTerms` its own `tax_display_mode: 'gross' | 'net'` column, independent of `price_kind_id`. A `/om-pre-implement-spec` audit found this created two unreconciled sources of truth: `catalog.CatalogPriceKind.displayMode` (`'including-tax' | 'excluding-tax'`, the field every existing gross/net computation in this codebase actually reads — `catalog`'s own `LineItemDialog.tsx` translates it 1:1) and this module's independent `tax_display_mode`, with no rule for what happens when an admin sets `price_kind_id` to an `excluding-tax` kind while leaving `tax_display_mode` at `'gross'`.

Fixed: `resolveTerms` resolves only `priceKindId` (§5.3). The consumer that needs a gross/net display mode (`ecommerce.storeContextService.resolve()`, spec 3, which already depends on `catalog` for price-kind data) derives it by reading the resolved price kind's `displayMode` and translating `'excluding-tax' → 'net'`, `'including-tax' → 'gross'` — the same translation `LineItemDialog.tsx` already performs. This module has no reason to depend on `catalog` just to duplicate that lookup; `ecommerce` already makes it as part of the same resolution step.

### 6.2 Anonymous and ungrouped buyers

`customerId: null` returns the default group (`is_default = true`) if one exists, otherwise an empty set and tenant-default terms with `allowPurchaseOnAccount: false`. The anonymous buyer's gross/net display mode falls out of §6.1a — derived from whichever price kind the channel binding resolves to for an anonymous request, not from a value returned here. Absence of a group MUST NOT be an error — an anonymous storefront visitor is the common case.

### 6.3 Concurrency Strategy

`reserveCredit`'s "serializable transaction; retry on serialization failure" (R1, this spec's own top risk) has **no reference implementation anywhere in this codebase** to copy — a repo-wide check found zero production use of Postgres `SERIALIZABLE` isolation. This is new infrastructure, not an established pattern, and must be built and unit-tested as its own reviewable unit before `reserveCredit` is wired to it:

- **Isolation level**: `withAtomicFlush` (`packages/shared/src/lib/commands/flush.ts`) already exposes an `isolationLevel` option passed through to `em.begin()`, but nothing in the repo exercises it with `'serializable'` today — confirm MikroORM's Postgres driver honors it end-to-end before relying on it.
- **Retry helper**: add a small, generically-named retry-on-serialization-failure helper (candidate home: `packages/shared/src/lib/commands/`, alongside `withAtomicFlush`) that catches Postgres error code `40001`, retries the transaction a bounded number of times (e.g. 3, with jittered backoff), and re-throws past the bound. `reserveCredit` wraps its limit re-check + ledger-append phase in `withAtomicFlush(em, phases, { transaction: true, isolationLevel: 'serializable' })` through this helper.
- **Do not treat "mirrors SPEC-055"** (this repo's promotions spec, which proposes the identical pattern for budget caps) **as precedent** — SPEC-055 is itself unimplemented spec-only text, not working code. Whichever of the two specs implements this helper first should be the one the other references.
- The N=20-parallel-reservation integration test (§13) is the acceptance gate for this helper, not for `reserveCredit` itself — write and merge the helper with its own concurrency test before Phase 3 begins.

### 6.4 Assortment scope resolves separately from the scalar terms (amended 2026-09-06)

`ResolvedTerms` originally carried an `assortmentScope` field resolved by §6.1's generic per-field algorithm. That is wrong, and [Buyer-Scoped Catalog Visibility](./2026-08-21-buyer-scoped-catalog-visibility.md) §1.1 shows why: §6.1's rule picks the highest-`priority` group's value and discards the rest, which is correct for a scalar setting (exactly one payment term must win) and incorrect for a **visibility grant**. A buyer in both "Wholesale" (scoped to a bulk-goods category) and "Q3 Preview" (scoped to a launch tag) would see only whichever group happens to carry the higher `priority` integer — a number the operator set to tie-break price rows, not to rank visibility. Adding a second, more permissive group would silently be a no-op.

Fixed: the `assortmentScope` field is **withdrawn** from `ResolvedTerms`, and `resolveAssortmentScope()` (§6) replaces it. It returns an `EffectiveAssortmentScope` — an OR-list of AND-scopes, one branch per contributing group — so grants combine additively regardless of priority. The type and its pure combinators (`matchesOne`, `matchesScope`, `unionScopes`, `intersectScopes`) live in `packages/shared/src/lib/catalog-visibility/`; that spec owns their definition and this one consumes it. Every other `ResolvedTerms` field is untouched and keeps resolving via §6.1 exactly as before — this is a single-field exception, stated once, not a change to the algorithm.

`customerId: null` (anonymous, or no matching groups) returns `{ scope: null, sourceGroupIds: [], sourceCustomerOverrideId: null }` — `null` meaning unrestricted, consistent with §6.2's rule that absence of a group MUST NOT be an error.

**Per-customer overrides resolve in the same call (added 2026-09-16).** A customer's own `CustomerAssortmentOverride` (§5.7) is applied here, inside this method, so that every consumer keeps receiving one finished `EffectiveAssortmentScope` and no caller learns how many sources produced it:

```
branches   = [ ...scopeOfEachMatchingGroup ]
if (override?.grantScope) branches.push(override.grantScope)   // omitted when absent — NEVER pushed as null,
                                                               // which unionScopes reads as "unrestricted source"
unioned    = unionScopes(branches)
buyerScope = intersectScopes(override?.restrictScope ?? null, unioned)
```

The grant widens (one more OR-branch, like an extra group) and the restriction narrows across every branch (the same operator the storefront channel's own scope uses). Setting both to the same scope yields "this customer sees only this," so no `mode` column exists. The override is bounded by the layers above it — `ecommerce` still intersects this result with the channel's own scope, and `require_authentication` short-circuits before this method is called at all — so an override can never reveal what a channel excludes. Full algebra, cache rule and risks: the visibility spec §3.6, §3.7, R8–R10.

## 7) Consumer Changes

### 7.1 `catalog` pricing

`PricingContext.customerGroupId?: string | null` becomes `customerGroupIds?: string[]`, and the matcher at `catalog/lib/pricing.ts:66` changes from equality to set membership.

**Ownership split with [Pricing Engine](./2026-08-21-pricing-engine.md) (resolved 2026-09-06).** Both specs touch this type; each owns one half, and neither restates the other's:

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| The `PricingContext` **type shape** — adding `customerGroupIds`, deprecating `customerGroupId`, adding `currencyCode`, and hardening `registerCatalogPricingResolver`'s registry | `2026-08-21-pricing-engine.md` Phase 2. It is `catalog`-internal infrastructure work in the module that owns the resolver. |
| The **group tie-break semantics** those ids resolve under | This spec, §3.2. Group precedence is the `customer_groups` domain rule. |

Pricing Engine's Edge Cases table names its tie-break a *provisional* default *"pending that sibling spec"* — this is that sibling spec, so the rule below is the one to implement, and Pricing Engine's provisional wording is superseded rather than contradicted.

**Tie-break, authoritative.** Resolution is unchanged at first order: `scorePrice`'s specificity score decides, and a matching group row still scores +3 at `catalog/lib/pricing.ts:84`. The second-order rule is what this spec adds — when two or more **equally-scored** rows match by way of *different* groups the buyer belongs to, the row whose group carries the highest `CustomerGroup.priority` wins (§3.2), ties broken by the most recently created membership. This is additive to `scorePrice`'s existing weights; it does **not** reorder them, and per `catalog/AGENTS.md` § Ask First, changing resolver priority semantics is explicitly out of scope for both specs.

**Backward compatibility.** `customerGroupId` is retained as a deprecated optional field for at least one minor version, normalized internally to `[customerGroupId]`. Marked `@deprecated` with a pointer to the replacement, per the deprecation protocol in `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`. `PricingContext` is a public type consumed by third-party modules; this is an additive change plus a deprecation, not a break. The `UPGRADE_NOTES.md` entry is authored once, by whichever of the two specs' phases lands first.

### 7.2 `sales` tax resolution

Same substitution in tax-rate matching. `SalesTaxRate.customerGroupId` (the rule side) is unchanged.

### 7.3 Admin UI

The current free-text UUID inputs for `customerGroupId` in the catalog price editor and the sales tax-rate form are replaced with a group picker sourced from `/api/customer-groups`. A row referencing an id with no matching group renders as an explicit `Unknown group (<uuid>)` error state — it is not hidden, because hiding it is how the orphan problem became invisible in the first place.

**Coupling direction (resolved).** The picker ships as a widget `customer_groups` injects into the `crud-form:catalog.catalog_product_price:fields` and `crud-form:sales.sales_tax_rate:fields` spots (`packages/core/AGENTS.md` → Widget Injection / CrudForm Field Injection), not as a `catalog`/`sales` import of `customer_groups`. `catalog` and `sales` gain **no new `requires` entry** — `pricing.ts:66,84`'s matching logic already only compares against a `customerGroupId[s]` value the caller supplies, so neither module needs a runtime dependency on `customer_groups` to function; `catalog` in particular keeps its current zero-`requires` status. If `customer_groups` is ejected, both forms fall back to their present-day free-text UUID input — no error, no degraded matching behavior, just the loss of the picker convenience and the `Unknown group` explainer. The price API filter (`catalog/api/prices/route.ts`) is unaffected either way; it already accepts a raw UUID.

---

## 8) Migration & Backward Compatibility

### 8.1 No foreign key in this release

`catalog_product_prices.customer_group_id` and `sales_tax_rates.customer_group_id` remain plain nullable UUIDs. Adding a FK would fail the migration on any tenant that has been using invented ids, and would change effective prices for the rest.

### 8.2 Orphan reconciliation

A CLI command `yarn mercato customer-groups:reconcile [--tenant <id>] [--adopt]` reports every distinct `customer_group_id` referenced by price rows or tax rates with no matching group, including affected row counts and a sample. With `--adopt` it creates a placeholder inactive group per orphan id (`code: orphan-<short-uuid>`, `is_active: false`, priority at the bottom) so the operator can rename and activate rather than re-key every row.

The same report is surfaced in the admin UI as a banner on the groups list while orphans exist.

### 8.3 Sequencing

Adding the FK constraint is explicitly out of scope and requires its own spec once tenants have run reconciliation.

---

## 9) API Contracts

All admin routes use `makeCrudRoute`, export `openApi`, validate with Zod, and support optimistic locking via `updated_at` per root `AGENTS.md`.

| Method | Path | Feature |
|---|---|---|
| GET/POST | `/api/customer-groups` | `customer_groups.groups.view` / `.manage` |
| GET/PUT/DELETE | `/api/customer-groups/:id` | idem |
| GET/POST | `/api/customer-groups/memberships` | `customer_groups.memberships.view` / `.manage` |
| PUT/DELETE | `/api/customer-groups/memberships/:id` | idem |
| GET/PUT | `/api/customer-groups/:id/terms` | `customer_groups.terms.view` / `.manage` |
| GET/POST | `/api/customer-groups/credit-accounts` | `customer_groups.credit.view` / `.manage` |
| PUT | `/api/customer-groups/credit-accounts/:id` | `customer_groups.credit.manage` |
| GET | `/api/customer-groups/credit-accounts/:id/ledger` | `customer_groups.credit.view` |
| POST | `/api/customer-groups/credit-accounts/:id/adjust` | `customer_groups.credit.adjust` |
| GET | `/api/customer-groups/approvals` | `customer_groups.approvals.view` |
| POST | `/api/customer-groups/approvals/:id/decide` | `customer_groups.approvals.decide` |
| GET | `/api/customer-groups/reconcile` | `customer_groups.groups.manage` |

The ledger has no update or delete route. Corrections go through `/adjust`, which appends a compensating entry.

### 9.1 ACL features (`acl.ts`)

```typescript
export const features = [
  { id: 'customer_groups.groups.view',       title: 'View customer groups' },
  { id: 'customer_groups.groups.manage',     title: 'Manage customer groups' },
  { id: 'customer_groups.memberships.view',  title: 'View group memberships' },
  { id: 'customer_groups.memberships.manage',title: 'Manage group memberships' },
  { id: 'customer_groups.terms.view',        title: 'View commercial terms' },
  { id: 'customer_groups.terms.manage',      title: 'Manage commercial terms' },
  { id: 'customer_groups.credit.view',       title: 'View credit accounts' },
  { id: 'customer_groups.credit.manage',     title: 'Manage credit limits' },
  { id: 'customer_groups.credit.adjust',     title: 'Post credit adjustments' },
  { id: 'customer_groups.approvals.view',    title: 'View purchase approvals' },
  { id: 'customer_groups.approvals.decide',  title: 'Decide purchase approvals' },
]
```

`credit.manage` (change the limit) and `credit.adjust` (move the balance) are separate on purpose — they are different kinds of financial authority and tenants will want to grant them to different roles.

---

## 10) Events

```typescript
'customer_groups.group.created' | '.updated' | '.deleted'
'customer_groups.membership.added' | '.removed' | '.expired'
'customer_groups.credit.reserved' | '.released' | '.settled' | '.limit_exceeded'
'customer_groups.credit_account.put_on_hold' | '.released_from_hold'
'customer_groups.approval.requested' | '.approved' | '.rejected' | '.expired'
'customer_groups.assortment_override.created' | '.updated' | '.deleted' | '.expired'
```

`customer_groups.membership.added` and `.removed` MUST invalidate any cached buyer context and any price cache keyed on that customer — see R2.

`customer_groups.assortment_override.*` carries the same duty for catalog visibility: it MUST invalidate the cached buyer context, the cached "does this customer have an override" probe (visibility spec §3.7) and any storefront cache entry keyed on that buyer's `assortmentScopeHash`. It is also a buyer-identity-class change for `cart`, which re-runs its whole-cart re-visibility pass on it exactly as it does on a membership change (`2026-08-14-cart-module.md` §5.2 trigger 2) — otherwise an override's `valid_until` would be the one buyer-side change that reaches checkout unchecked.

`customer_groups.credit.limit_exceeded` drives an in-app notification to the account manager; a blocked B2B checkout that nobody is told about becomes a support ticket.

---

## 11) Background Jobs

| Job | Cadence | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `expire-memberships` | hourly | Emit `.expired` for memberships whose `valid_until` has passed; invalidate caches |
| `expire-approvals` | hourly | Transition `pending` approvals past `expires_at` to `expired` |
| `credit-exposure-audit` | daily | Recompute `SUM(amount)` per account and compare against the last `balance_after`; report drift (drift means a bug, and it must be visible) |

---

## 12) Risks & Impact Review

| # | Risk | Severity | Area | Failure scenario | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Concurrent credit overshoot | **Critical** | `customer_groups`, `checkout` | Two purchase-on-account checkouts for the same customer each read exposure 80k against a 100k limit, each reserves 30k, exposure lands at 140k. The tenant has extended 40k of unsecured credit it never approved. | `reserveCredit` runs the limit re-check and the ledger append in one `SERIALIZABLE` transaction via the retry helper specified in §6.3 (no reference implementation exists in this codebase — build and unit-test it first); concurrency test with N parallel reservations against a limit is a merge gate | Low, once §6.3's helper lands and is proven under the concurrency test |
| R2 | Stale group membership in cache | **High** | `catalog`, `ecommerce` | A customer is removed from "Wholesale" at 14:00; a price cached at 13:59 keyed only on product+channel keeps serving the wholesale price for the rest of its TTL. Revenue loss, and the reverse case discloses contract pricing. | Buyer-context digest (ADR-7) includes the sorted group id set; `membership.added`/`.removed` invalidate by tag `customer:{id}`; membership expiry runs hourly and also invalidates | Medium — a membership expiring between hourly runs serves a stale group for up to an hour; acceptable for `valid_until`, which is operator-scheduled, and documented |
| R3 | Orphan ids silently change prices | **High** | `catalog`, `sales` | An operator creates a group and, coincidentally or by copying, its id collides with an invented one already in price rows. Rows that previously never matched suddenly apply. | Generated UUIDs make accidental collision negligible; the real vector is `--adopt`, which is explicit and reversible; reconciliation report runs before any group creation is recommended in the rollout note | Low |
| R4 | Priority uniqueness blocks bulk import | Medium | `customer_groups` | Unique `(tenant_id, priority)` makes importing a group list fail on the first collision, mid-import. | Import assigns priorities in gaps of 10 and renumbers on conflict; the admin list supports drag-reorder which rewrites priorities in one transaction | Low |
| R5 | Terms inheritance is opaque | Medium | `customer_groups` | A buyer gets an unexpected payment term; support cannot tell which of four overlapping groups supplied it. | `ResolvedTerms.sourceGroupId` per field; admin "explain terms" panel on the customer detail page renders the resolution trace | Low |
| R6 | Deep group hierarchies degrade resolution | Low | `customer_groups` | Recursive ancestor walks on every price call. | Depth capped at 5; resolution result cached per `(customerId, date-bucket)` for 60s with tag `customer:{id}` | Low |
| R7 | `PricingContext` change breaks third-party modules | Medium | `catalog` | A third-party module constructs `PricingContext` with `customerGroupId` and stops matching after the change. | Field retained and normalized for ≥1 minor version with `@deprecated`; documented in `UPGRADE_NOTES.md`; per `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md` this is ADDITIVE plus deprecation | Low |
| R8 | Approval double-decision | Low | `customer_groups` | Two approvers open the same request and both decide. | `updated_at`-based optimistic locking on `CustomerPurchaseApproval` (§5.6) via `enforceCommandOptimisticLock` on the `/decide` action route; the second decision surfaces the conflict bar via `surfaceRecordConflict` | Low |

---

## 13) Integration Coverage

Per `.ai/qa/AGENTS.md`, shipping in the same change. Tests create their own fixtures and clean up; no reliance on seed data.

**API paths** — every route in §9, each asserting tenant isolation with a second-tenant fixture.

**Behavioural:**
- Group resolution with overlapping memberships returns priority-ordered ids
- Membership outside its validity window is excluded at the boundary instants
- Terms inheritance resolves per field across a 3-level hierarchy with `sourceGroupId` correct for each
- Price resolution picks the highest-priority group's row when two group rows match
- Tax resolution likewise
- Deprecated `customerGroupId` on `PricingContext` yields the same result as `customerGroupIds: [id]`
- `reserveCredit` under N=20 parallel calls against a limit admitting 3 reserves exactly 3
- `reserveCredit` with a repeated `idempotencyKey` is a no-op returning the original entry
- Exposure equals `SUM(amount)`; the daily audit reports zero drift
- Reconciliation lists orphans and `--adopt` creates inactive placeholders
- Anonymous (`customerId: null`) resolves to the default group without error

**UI paths:** group list with drag-reorder, group edit with terms, membership assignment from the customer detail page, credit account edit with optimistic-lock conflict, ledger view, approval decision, orphan banner.

---

## 14) Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 — Groups and membership
Entities `CustomerGroup`, `CustomerGroupMembership`; `resolveGroups`; admin CRUD; group picker replacing the UUID inputs in `catalog` and `sales`; reconciliation CLI and banner.

**Gate:** a price row authored against a real group resolves for a member and not for a non-member; orphan report is accurate.

### Phase 2 — Commercial terms
`CustomerGroupTerms`; `resolveTerms` with per-field inheritance and `sourceGroupId`; explain-terms admin panel; `catalog` and `sales` consume group id **sets**.

**Gate:** terms resolve correctly across a 3-level hierarchy; the deprecated single-value path is behaviourally identical.

### Phase 3 — Credit
`CustomerCreditAccount`, `CustomerCreditLedgerEntry`; `checkCredit` / `reserveCredit` / `releaseCredit` / `settleCredit`; admin credit UI and ledger; exposure audit job.

**Gate:** the N-parallel reservation test passes; idempotent retry verified; audit reports zero drift.

### Phase 4 — Approvals
`CustomerPurchaseApproval`; request and decision flow; approver resolution via `CustomerEntityRole`; notifications.

**Gate:** an over-threshold subject routes to approval and cannot proceed until decided; double-decision surfaces a conflict.

### Phase 5 — Per-customer assortment overrides
`CustomerAssortmentOverride` (§5.7) and its `data/extensions.ts` link; `resolveAssortmentScope` extended per §6.4 to union the grant and intersect the restriction, returning `sourceCustomerOverrideId`; the override's CRUD events and their invalidation duty (§10); the injected "Assortment" section on the customer detail page. Tracked as Phase 4 of the visibility spec, which owns the algebra, the cache rule and the tests.

**Gate:** a grant-only override widens without losing any group grant; a restriction cuts a product a group granted; an absent grant does not unrestrict the buyer; a buyer with no override row resolves byte-identically to the group-only result.

Phases 1 and 2 unblock the rest of the ecommerce suite. Phases 3 and 4 are required only by checkout (spec 7) and may land in parallel with specs 3–5. Phase 5 depends only on Phase 2 and is deliberately sequenced after the visibility spec's own Phase 3 (the cart write-side enforcement), so a merchandising convenience does not ship ahead of that spec's Critical fix.

---

## 15) Open Questions

1. **Rule-driven membership** — `source: 'rule'` is in the model but no rule engine is specified. Automatic assignment ("all customers with >100k lifetime revenue join Wholesale") is a natural fit for `business_rules`. *Deferred; the enum value reserves the space.*
2. **Per-organization vs. per-tenant groups** — groups are tenant-scoped here, consistent with `CatalogPriceKind`, which allows a null `organization_id`. Whether an organization can define private groups is unresolved. *Assumed no for v1.*
3. **Credit currency** — one account per currency. A customer trading in PLN and EUR has two independent limits with no aggregate cap. *Assumed acceptable; a group-level aggregate cap would need FX and is out of scope.*

---

## 16) Final Compliance Report

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| No cross-module ORM relations | `customer_id` and `price_kind_id` are FK ids; no `@ManyToOne` crosses a module boundary |
| Tenant/organization scoping | Every entity scoped; every test asserts isolation against a second tenant |
| Zod validation in `data/validators.ts` | All routes; types via `z.infer` |
| No `any` | Service contract fully typed |
| Optimistic locking | Platform-standard `updated_at` mechanism only (§5.4, §5.6) — no `version` counter; `CustomerCreditAccount` uses `CrudForm`'s auto-derived header, `CustomerPurchaseApproval`'s `/decide` action route uses `enforceCommandOptimisticLock`; all editable entities expose `updatedAt` for `CrudForm` |
| Concurrency strategy | §6.3 — `reserveCredit`'s `SERIALIZABLE` + retry-on-40001 is new infrastructure with no reference implementation in this repo; helper built and unit-tested independently before Phase 3 |
| Cross-module coupling | §7.3 — admin group picker ships as a `crud-form:<entityId>:fields` widget injected by `customer_groups`; `catalog`/`sales` gain no new `requires` entry |
| Encryption | Credit limits and ledger amounts are commercially sensitive but not GDPR special categories; standard scoping applies, no field encryption — consistent with existing precedent (`sales`/`payment_gateways` encrypt blob/secret columns, not scalar monetary columns) |
| Backward compatibility | `PricingContext.customerGroupId` deprecated, not removed; no FK constraint added; documented in `UPGRADE_NOTES.md` |
| i18n | No hard-coded user-facing strings; `en.json` and `pl.json` |
| Migrations | `yarn db:generate` per entity batch, snapshot reviewed |
| Integration coverage | §13, shipping in the same change |

## 17) User Story Map (Prototype Input)

Added 2026-08-31 to support the `om-mockup-prototype` backend click-through. Derived from §13's UI-path list and the data models/API contracts in §5–§9; no new scope. Roles are backoffice unless noted.

### Epic A — Group Management
Operator authors the commercial-group catalog and its precedence.

- **US-A1** — As a commerce operator, I want to create and edit customer groups with a priority and optional parent, so that I can express overlapping B2B tiers (e.g. "Wholesale", "Q3 Promo Tier") with unambiguous precedence.
  - AC: empty state (no groups yet) shows a "Create your first group" CTA, not a bare empty table.
  - AC: create/edit form validates unique `code` and unique `priority` within the tenant inline, before submit.
  - AC: the list supports drag-reorder; dropping a row rewrites affected `priority` values in one transaction (per R4) and the change is visible immediately, no page reload.
  - AC: `parent_id` picker excludes the group itself and any descendant (cycle prevention) and warns when depth would exceed 5.
  - AC: `is_default` is a toggle; enabling it on one group and attempting to enable it on a second shows an inline conflict ("X is currently default — enabling this will replace it") rather than a silent double-default.
  - AC: deleting a group with active memberships or terms shows a confirm dialog naming the dependent counts (per platform optimistic-lock delete pattern); Escape cancels, Cmd/Ctrl+Enter confirms.
  - AC: `is_active = false` groups remain visible in the list (filterable), never disappear, since history depends on them.

- **US-A2** — As an operator, I want an orphan-reference banner on the groups list and a reconciliation report, so that price rows or tax rates pointing at unmodeled UUIDs are visible instead of silently inert (§8.2, R3).
  - AC: banner shows only while `GET /api/customer-groups/reconcile` reports orphans > 0, with the count.
  - AC: report screen lists each orphan UUID, its affected-row count, and a sample of referencing rows (catalog price / tax rate) with a link to each.
  - AC: report empty state ("No orphaned references") replaces the banner-triggering table when the count is zero.
  - AC: "Adopt" action requires a confirm naming how many placeholder groups will be created, since it is a real write (`is_active: false`, `code: orphan-<short-uuid>`); result list is highlighted so the operator can rename/activate them next.

### Epic B — Group Membership
Operator manages which customers belong to which groups and for how long.

- **US-B1** — As an operator, I want to assign a customer to a group with an optional validity window from the customer detail page, so that time-bounded commercial relationships (a seasonal contract, a trial tier) are explicit and expire on their own.
  - AC: assignment form defaults `valid_from` to now and `valid_until` to empty (= indefinite); both are optional per §5.2.
  - AC: assigning the same customer to a group they already (currently or historically, non-deleted) belong to is blocked with an inline "already a member of this group" error — the unique constraint is surfaced before submit, not as a raw 500/409.
  - AC: assigning to a *different* group while already a member of another is allowed with no warning (overlapping membership is expected, §2.3).
  - AC: the membership list on the customer detail page shows current, upcoming (`valid_from` in the future), and expired memberships with distinct status pills; expired rows are read-only.
  - AC: removing a membership is a soft delete behind a confirm dialog (Escape cancel, Cmd/Ctrl+Enter confirm).

### Epic C — Commercial Terms
Operator sets, and support explains, the per-group buying terms.

- **US-C1** — As an operator, I want to edit a group's commercial terms (price kind, payment terms, credit default, approval threshold, min order, assortment scope), so that a B2B buyer in that group automatically gets the right pricing, payment, and approval behavior at checkout.
  - AC: a group with no terms row yet shows an explicit "No terms set — inheriting from parent / tenant defaults" empty state, not a form pre-filled with blanks that look like explicit zeros.
  - AC: `price_kind_id` is a picker sourced from `catalog` price kinds, not a free-text id (contrast with the *rule*-side `customerGroupId` columns this spec explicitly leaves as free text — §7.3 note applies only there).
  - AC: numeric fields (`default_credit_limit`, `approval_required_above`, `min_order_value`) reject negative input inline.
  - AC: saving over a stale version shows the platform conflict bar (`surfaceRecordConflict`) with the concurrent editor's change summarized, per the optimistic-locking rule in root `AGENTS.md`.
  - AC: `assortment_scope` uses the same category/tag/exclude picker pattern as the channel-binding scope elsewhere in the app — do not invent a new picker.

- **US-C2** — As a support agent, I want an "explain terms" panel on the customer detail page, so that when a buyer asks "why do I have net-30 instead of net-60" I can answer without guessing across four overlapping groups (R5).
  - AC: each resolved scalar field (`priceKindId`, `paymentTermsDays`, `allowPurchaseOnAccount`, `approvalRequiredAbove`, `minOrderValue`) shows its value and the group it came from (`sourceGroupId`).
  - AC: assortment scope is shown in its own row, sourced from `resolveAssortmentScope()` rather than `resolveTerms()` (§6.4), and names **every** contributing group (`sourceGroupIds`, plural) — it is a union across groups, not a single highest-priority winner, so a single-source label would misrepresent it.
  - AC: when the customer carries an override (§5.7), that row also names it (`sourceCustomerOverrideId`) **alongside** the contributing groups, split into its widening and narrowing halves — naming only the group union would attribute a customer-specific rule to groups that did not make it, which is the wrong answer to the question this panel exists to answer.
  - AC: a field with `sourceGroupId: null` is labeled "tenant default", not left blank.
  - AC: the trace is a visible ancestor path (child → parent → tenant), not a tooltip that must be discovered.

- **US-C3** — As an operator, I want to widen *or* narrow one named customer's assortment independently of their groups, so that I can give a single account early access to a collection, or hold it to its contracted assortment, without creating a group of one (§5.7, added 2026-09-16).
  - AC: the customer detail page carries an "Assortment" section injected by this module (§5.7, §7.3), with two blocks labelled by **direction** — "Also allow" (`grant_scope`) and "Restrict to / exclude" (`restrict_scope`) — plus the validity window and `notes`.
  - AC: empty state — a customer with no override row shows both blocks empty and a line stating their assortment comes entirely from their groups; saving both blocks empty writes **no row**, rather than an empty one.
  - AC: "Also allow" can only add: everything the customer's groups grant survives, since the grant joins the union as one more branch (§6.4).
  - AC: "Restrict to / exclude" narrows across **every** group grant, not only the products this override itself added — the direction no group-level scope can express; the screen states the consequence before saving.
  - AC: setting both blocks to the same scope yields "this customer sees only this"; the resulting "replacement" label is **derived from the two values and read-only**, because §6.4 deliberately has no `mode` column for it to disagree with.
  - AC: the validity window uses the same semantics as a membership (§5.2) — `valid_from` null = always, `valid_until` null = indefinite.
  - AC: permission — gated behind the same feature that gates group-terms editing (US-C1); a viewer without it sees the section **read-only rather than hidden**, so a bespoke account stays recognisable as one.
  - AC: the pickers are the same category/tag/exclude widget US-C1 and the channel-binding scope already use — do not invent a third.

### Epic D — Group Picker in Catalog & Sales
Operator references a group from a price row or tax rate without inventing a UUID.

- **US-D1** — As an operator editing a catalog price row or a sales tax rate, I want to pick a customer group by name instead of pasting a UUID, so that I can't typo a group reference into permanent silence (§2.1).
  - AC: the picker is searchable by code/name, shows `priority` inline so precedence is visible while authoring.
  - AC: a price row or tax rate whose stored `customer_group_id` matches no group renders an explicit `Unknown group (<uuid>)` error chip in place of the picker's normal selected-value display — never hidden (§7.3).
  - AC: the same picker widget renders identically in both host forms (`catalog.catalog_product_price` and `sales.sales_tax_rate`), since it is one injected widget per §7.3.

### Epic E — Credit Accounts & Ledger
Finance operator manages purchase-on-account exposure.

- **US-E1** — As a finance operator, I want to view a customer's credit account and its ledger, so that I see current exposure as a computed fact rather than trusting a counter that could have drifted (§4.3, R1).
  - AC: exposure is displayed as `SUM(amount)` over ledger entries — the screen never shows `balance_after` as the primary number, only as a per-row audit annotation.
  - AC: editing `credit_limit` is optimistic-lock protected; a stale save shows the conflict bar rather than silently overwriting a concurrent change.
  - AC: toggling `is_on_hold` requires a `hold_reason` before it can be saved; once on hold, the account's status badge reflects it regardless of computed exposure.
  - AC: the ledger table is read-only and append-only — there is no row-level edit or delete action, matching §5.5's "no update or delete route."
  - AC: "Adjust" opens a dialog that appends a new `adjust` entry with a required note; it is visually distinct from `reserve`/`release`/`settle` entries (which the UI never creates directly — those come from checkout flows outside this prototype's scope).

### Epic F — Purchase Approvals
Approver/account manager reviews over-threshold purchase requests.

- **US-F1** — As an approver, I want to see pending purchase approval requests and decide them, so that an over-threshold B2B order doesn't proceed without the sign-off the group's `approval_required_above` term requires.
  - AC: the pending list shows customer, requester, subject type, snapshot amount, and time remaining until `expires_at`.
  - AC: deciding opens a dialog with Approve/Reject and an optional note; Cmd/Ctrl+Enter submits, Escape cancels.
  - AC: deciding against a stale snapshot (a second approver already decided) surfaces the conflict bar naming who decided and when, rather than silently double-deciding (R8) — this is illustrative in the prototype since the underlying `enforceCommandOptimisticLock` check is server-side.
  - AC: an approval past `expires_at` renders as a read-only "Expired" row with no decide action available.

### Cross-cutting rules (apply to every screen above)

- Every dialog: Cmd/Ctrl+Enter submits, Escape cancels (root `AGENTS.md`).
- Every list: `pageSize` ≤ 100, an explicit empty state, and an explicit no-access state distinct from empty.
- The optimistic-lock conflict bar is the same visual pattern across Group Terms, Credit Account, and Approval Decide — one component, three call sites.
- No hardcoded status colors; group `kind` (`b2c | b2b | internal | partner`), membership status, approval status, and credit-hold status all use DS status tokens.
- The group picker (Epic D) is one widget rendered in two host forms — do not draw it twice as different components.

## 18) Changelog

### 2026-09-16 (per-customer assortment overrides)

- **§17** — added **US-C3** for the new entity, and extended US-C2's assortment-scope acceptance criterion so the explain-terms panel names the customer's own override beside the contributing groups. Without it the story map described a panel that would attribute a customer-specific rule to the groups, which is the one answer that panel must not give.

Applied from [Buyer-Scoped Catalog Visibility](./2026-08-21-buyer-scoped-catalog-visibility.md) §3.6, where the user raised per-customer visibility as a requirement in both directions and the algebra, cache rule and storage decisions were taken.

- **New entity §5.7 `CustomerAssortmentOverride`** — one optional, sparse row per customer with `grant_scope` (widens) and `restrict_scope` (narrows), a validity window and a notes field. Declared as an **entity extension** of `customers:customer_entity` in `customer_groups/data/extensions.ts` per root `AGENTS.md`, not as columns on the customer entity.
- **§6 / §6.4** — `resolveAssortmentScope()` resolves the override in the same call and returns `sourceCustomerOverrideId`; the grant joins the union as one more branch, the restriction is intersected over every branch. No new operator, and no change to any consumer: the method already returned a finished `EffectiveAssortmentScope`.
- **§10** — new `customer_groups.assortment_override.*` events with an explicit invalidation duty (buyer context, the override-existence probe, `assortmentScopeHash`-keyed entries) and a stated obligation on `cart`'s trigger-2 re-visibility pass, so an override lapsing cannot reach checkout unchecked.
- **§14** — new Phase 5, sequenced after the visibility spec's cart-enforcement phase.

### 2026-09-06 (sibling amendments applied)

Applied the amendments [Buyer-Scoped Catalog Visibility](./2026-08-21-buyer-scoped-catalog-visibility.md) §0 records against this document, rather than leaving them pending in a sibling file — both documents ship together, so a deferred amendment would have left an implementer building from §6 alone shipping a field a neighbouring spec calls withdrawn.

- **`ResolvedTerms.assortmentScope` withdrawn** (§6), replaced by `resolveAssortmentScope()` returning an `EffectiveAssortmentScope` plus `sourceGroupIds`. Added §6.4 stating why a visibility grant cannot follow §6.1's highest-priority-wins rule. Every other `ResolvedTerms` field is unchanged.
- **`CustomerGroupTerms.assortment_scope`** (§5.3) retyped to the shared `AssortmentScope` from `packages/shared/src/lib/catalog-visibility/`, gaining `excludeCategoryIds` / `excludeTagIds`. Additive jsonb keys inside an already-planned column — no migration change.
- §17 US-C2 updated: the explain-terms panel shows assortment scope in its own row naming every contributing group, not as a `sourceGroupId` scalar.

Also recorded the `PricingContext` ownership split with [Pricing Engine](./2026-08-21-pricing-engine.md) — see §7.1.

### 2026-08-31 (story map)
- Added §17 User Story Map to support the `om-mockup-prototype` backend click-through: 6 epics, 8 stories, UX acceptance criteria (empty/permission/error/optimistic-lock/keyboard/default-value states) derived from §13's UI-path list and §5–§9's data/API contracts. No scope change.

### 2026-08-17 (rev 2)
- Removed `CustomerGroupTerms.tax_display_mode`: found by the `/om-pre-implement-spec` audit on the sibling `SPEC-029-2026-02-17-ecommerce-storefront-module.md` (v4) to be an unreconciled second source of truth alongside `price_kind_id` — the only real gross/net computation path in this codebase (`catalog`'s `LineItemDialog.tsx`) always derives display mode from the price kind's own `displayMode`, never from an independent buyer-level field. Added §6.1a documenting the fix: gross/net is derived downstream by `ecommerce` from the resolved `priceKindId`, not carried in `ResolvedTerms`.

### 2026-08-17 (rev 1)
- Fixed three Critical gaps found by a `/om-pre-implement-spec` audit (see `ANALYSIS-2026-08-14-customer-groups-and-b2b-terms.md` in the upstream repo): removed the functionally-inert `version` optimistic-locking column from `CustomerCreditAccount` (§5.4) and `CustomerPurchaseApproval` (§5.6) in favor of this platform's actual `updated_at` + header-protocol mechanism; added §6.3 Concurrency Strategy specifying that the `SERIALIZABLE`-retry helper for `reserveCredit` has no reference implementation and must be built independently; resolved §7.3's admin-picker coupling direction as `crud-form:<entityId>:fields` widget injection, confirming `catalog`/`sales` gain no new `requires` entry.
- Updated R8 and §16 accordingly.

### 2026-08-14
- Initial specification.
- Grounded in a survey of `customer_group_id` consumers: `catalog/lib/pricing.ts` (lines 65–66 matching, 83–84 scoring), `catalog/api/prices/route.ts`, `catalog/commands/prices.ts`, `catalog/commands/variants.ts`, `catalog/ai-tools/prices-offers-pack.ts`, `catalog/data/entities.ts`, `sales/data/entities.ts` (`SalesTaxRate`) — none of which is backed by an owning table.
- Existing B2B surface reused rather than replaced: `CustomerCompanyProfile`, `CustomerCompanyBilling.payment_terms`, `CustomerEntityRole`, `CustomerPersonCompanyRole`.
