## TLDR

**Key Points:**
- A channel-agnostic basket module. `Cart` and `CartLine` are first-class entities addressed by an opaque token, usable by the storefront, POS, pay links and AI purchasing agents alike. Checkout consumes a cart; it does not own one.
- **The cart does no arithmetic.** It resolves unit prices via `catalogPricingService`, discounts via `promotionsService`, then hands `SalesLineSnapshot[]` to `salesCalculationService.calculateDocumentTotals` with `documentKind: 'quote'`. Cart totals and order totals are produced by the same code, so they cannot disagree.
- Prices are **snapshotted per line with a resolution stamp**, and re-priced on a defined set of triggers. A cart that silently re-prices mid-session is as broken as one that never does; the trigger list is the contract.
- B2B changes cart behaviour in ways B2C never exercises: quantity breaks re-price the whole line as quantity crosses a tier, pack increments constrain quantities, and an over-threshold cart routes to approval before checkout.

**Scope:**
- `Cart`, `CartLine`, `CartPromotionApplication`, `CartMergeLog`
- Line management, price snapshotting and the re-pricing trigger set
- Totals via `salesCalculationService`; promotion effects via `promotionsService`
- Optimistic locking, idempotent mutation, guest→customer merge
- TTL, abandonment events, cleanup
- Public token-bound API

**Concerns:**
- Guest→customer merge has no universally correct rule; the chosen policy must be explicit, reversible and logged, because getting it wrong silently deletes a buyer's basket
- Optimistic locking on a cart that the server itself re-prices means the server can bump the version under a client that did nothing wrong; re-pricing must not be indistinguishable from a concurrent edit
- Promotion evaluation on every mutation is expensive; caching it is unsafe because the rule tree depends on the whole cart

---

## 1) Overview

A cart is a priced, mutable collection of intended purchases belonging to a buyer or an anonymous visitor, valid for a bounded period, in one currency, for one store.

That is the whole domain. Everything adjacent — who the buyer is, what an address is, how delivery is chosen, how payment is taken, what an order is — belongs to another module. The cart's discipline is knowing what it is not.

---

## 2) Problem Statement

### 2.1 Nothing owns a basket

Four channels need one and none has one. SPEC-029 v3 proposed folding the basket into a checkout session, which makes it the storefront funnel's private state. POS (SPEC-022) would then need its own, pay links have `CheckoutCartItem` shaped for merchant-defined static contents rather than shopper mutation, and an AI purchasing agent would have nowhere to assemble a proposal before asking for approval.

### 2.2 Totals must not be reimplemented

`sales` owns `SalesTaxRate` and a calculation service with line hooks, totals hooks, adjustment drafts and an event bus. Any basket computing its own tax will disagree with the order it produces — not hypothetically, but on the first compound tax rate or rounding boundary. The consequence is an invoice that does not match the price the buyer accepted.

### 2.3 Snapshot versus live price

Neither extreme works. A cart holding a price forever lets a buyer check out at last month's price. A cart re-resolving on every read changes the total while the buyer is looking at it, including downward-then-upward as a promotion window closes. What is needed is a snapshot with defined invalidation, and that set of triggers has to be written down.

### 2.4 B2B is not B2C with a different price

A wholesale line at quantity 99 and the same line at 100 are different prices per unit, because `CatalogProductPrice.min_quantity` says so. Pack increments make quantity 7 invalid where 6 and 8 are fine. An order above the group's `approval_required_above` cannot proceed to checkout at all. None of this exists in a B2C basket, and all of it is line-level behaviour that belongs here rather than in checkout.

---

## 3) Architecture

### 3.1 Position

```
storefront / POS / pay link / AI agent
              │  cart token (opaque)
              ▼
        ┌──────────┐
        │   cart   │   lines, quantities, snapshots, totals, TTL
        └────┬─────┘
             ├──► catalog       catalogPricingService — unit price for THIS buyer & quantity
             ├──► promotions    promotionsService.evaluate(cart) — resolved effects
             ├──► availability  availabilityService.check() — advisory state + quantity rules
             ├──► sales         salesCalculationService.calculateDocumentTotals() — ALL arithmetic
             └──► customer_groups  resolveTerms() — tax mode, min order, approval threshold
```

`cart` has no inbound dependency. `checkout` reads it; it does not read `checkout`.

### 3.1a Commands (fixed 2026-08-17)

Every mutation is a registered command, mirroring `sales/commands/documents.ts` — this module has no exemption from root `AGENTS.md`'s "domain writes go through commands" rule, and an earlier draft of this spec had none of these, describing mutations as plain HTTP handlers instead:

```
cart.lines.add · cart.lines.update · cart.lines.remove · cart.lines.bulkAdd
cart.promotions.apply · cart.promotions.remove
cart.merge · cart.mergeUndo
cart.approval.request
cart.reprice
```

Each command's `execute` phase runs the optimistic-lock pre-check (§8.1) before touching the entity manager, then mutates `Cart`/`CartLine`/`CartPromotionApplication` inside `withAtomicFlush(em, phases, { transaction: true, label: 'cart.<op>' })` — not a raw conditional SQL update — because the write flow (load → call `catalogPricingService`/`promotionsService` → call `salesCalculationService.calculateDocumentTotals` → persist totals) is exactly the multi-phase "mutate → external work → mutate again" shape that helper exists to protect. Side effects (`emitCrudSideEffects`, cache invalidation, `clientBroadcast` events) fire after commit, never inside the atomic-flush block. `cart.lines.add`/`.remove` and `cart.merge` carry meaningful undo via `extractUndoPayload`; `cart.reprice` and pricing-triggered re-snapshots are not undoable (re-pricing to a stale price is not a state a client would ever want restored) and are documented as such.

### 3.2 Totals

```typescript
const result = await salesCalculationService.calculateDocumentTotals({
  documentKind: 'quote',
  lines: cart.lines.map(toSalesLineSnapshot),          // line/unit promotion effects ride here
  adjustments: orderScopedEffects.map(toSalesAdjustmentDraft),
  context: { tenantId, organizationId, currencyCode, metadata: { source: 'cart', cartId } },
})
```

`documentKind: 'quote'` reuses the existing `SalesDocumentKind` union (`'order' | 'quote' | 'invoice' | 'credit_memo'`) rather than extending it. A quote is precisely what a cart is — a non-binding priced document — and extending the union would ripple into document sequences, search indexing and the documents table for no gain.

The mapping is direct because `SalesLineSnapshot` already carries `productId`, `productVariantId`, `quantity`, `quantityUnit`, `uomSnapshot`, `unitPriceNet`, `unitPriceGross`, `discountAmount`, `taxRate`, `configuration` and even `promotionCode`. `SalesAdjustmentDraft` carries `scope: 'order' | 'line'`, `promotionId`, `amountNet`/`amountGross` and `position`. Promotion effects map onto these shapes without inventing a parallel model.

**Promotion effects split by target**, per SPEC-055 §B.6 — they do not all become adjustment drafts. Only `appliesTo: 'order'` effects (`CART_DISCOUNT`, `DELIVERY_DISCOUNT`) become `SalesAdjustmentDraft`. A `LINE_DISCOUNT` becomes `SalesLineSnapshot.discountAmount` on the matching line, because `SalesAdjustmentDraft` carries no line reference and `sales` currently rejects a line-attributed draft outright (`documents.ts` — *"Line-scoped adjustments are not supported yet."*). Three rules bind this mapping, each of them a mispriced cart if broken:

1. `discountAmount` is **per-unit over the line's full quantity**: assign `|amount| / lineQuantity` — never `unitAmount`, never the raw `amount`, and divide by `lineQuantity` rather than `appliedQuantity`. There is no basis flag to pick: `buildBaseLineResult` (`packages/core/src/modules/sales/lib/calculations.ts:80-123`) reads `discountAmount` as `discountPerUnit` and computes `min(max(discountPerUnit × quantity, 0), netSubtotalBeforeDiscount)` for every document kind. A benefit covering 5 of 8 units at −2.40 has `amount: "-12.00"`, so `discountAmount = 1.50` and `sales` reproduces `1.50 × 8 = 12.00`; assigning `unitAmount` would discount 19.20 and assigning `amount` 96.00. Where `lineQuantity` does not divide the total the 4 dp rounding (`calculations.ts:22-24`) leaves a sub-cent gap — the document total is authoritative, the effect's `amount` is the display figure.
2. `discountAmount` is a positive magnitude on a **net** basis; take the absolute value, and convert when the effect's `basis` is `'gross'`.
3. Several cumulative promotions on one line sum into that single scalar. Per-promotion attribution on the line does not survive; it lives in `PromotionUsage.effects_snapshot`.

SPEC-055 §B.7 defers giving `SalesAdjustmentDraft` a `lineId` to its own spec against `sales`, on blast-radius grounds — `sales` is shipped code with live orders, quotes and returns, while `cart` and `promotions` are both greenfield.

**The cart stores the returned totals verbatim.** It does not round, re-sum or adjust them.

## 4) Data Models

Standard scoped columns throughout.

### 4.1 `Cart` (`carts`)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `token` | text | Opaque, unguessable, 32+ bytes of CSPRNG entropy, base64url. The public identifier |
| `store_id` | uuid, nullable | `ecommerce.EcommerceStore.id`; null for non-storefront channels |
| `channel` | text | `storefront \| pos \| pay_link \| agent \| api` |
| `sales_channel_id` | uuid, nullable | `sales.SalesChannel.id` |
| `status` | text | `active \| locked \| converted \| abandoned \| expired \| merged` |
| `currency_code` | text | Fixed at creation |
| `locale` | text | |
| `customer_id` | uuid, nullable | `customers.CustomerEntity.id` |
| `customer_user_id` | uuid, nullable | `customer_accounts.CustomerUser.id` |
| `customer_group_ids` | jsonb | `string[]` snapshot at last pricing, for drift detection |
| `price_kind_id` | uuid, nullable | Snapshot at last pricing |
| `tax_mode` | text | `gross \| net` |
| `email` | text, nullable | Guest identification; encrypted at rest — declared in `cart/encryption.ts`'s `defaultEncryptionMaps: [{ entityId: 'cart:cart', fields: [{ field: 'email' }] }]` (fixed 2026-08-17; an earlier draft asserted this in §17 without a backing declaration anywhere in the module) |
| `buyer_digest` | text | `StoreContext.digest` at last pricing — the drift detector |
| `totals` | jsonb | Verbatim `SalesDocumentCalculationResult.totals` |
| `totals_computed_at` | timestamptz | |
| `promotion_effects` | jsonb | Resolved effects from the last evaluation, for display |
| `requires_approval` | boolean | Set when gross exceeds the group threshold |
| `approval_id` | uuid, nullable | `customer_groups.CustomerPurchaseApproval.id` |
| `note` | text, nullable | Buyer-supplied |
| `metadata` | jsonb, nullable | |
| `merged_into_cart_id` | uuid, nullable | Set when `status = 'merged'` |
| `last_activity_at` | timestamptz | Drives abandonment |
| `expires_at` | timestamptz | TTL |

Indexes: unique `token`; `(tenant_id, customer_id, status)`; `(tenant_id, status, expires_at)` for the sweeper; `(tenant_id, status, last_activity_at)` for abandonment.

**No `version` column** (fixed 2026-08-17): an earlier draft added one for optimistic locking, but this platform's optimistic-lock helpers (`enforceCommandOptimisticLock`, `packages/shared/src/lib/crud/optimistic-lock-command.ts`) are hard-coded to ISO-timestamp comparison against `updated_at` — a generic integer counter cannot plug into them, and duplicating them for a bespoke `version` token was the same mistake already made and fixed in the sibling `customer-groups-and-b2b-terms.md` spec. `Cart.updatedAt` (from "Standard scoped columns," above) is the sole concurrency token — see §8.1.

### 4.2 `CartLine` (`cart_lines`)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `cart_id` | uuid | FK → `carts` |
| `line_number` | integer | Stable display order |
| `product_id` | uuid | `catalog.CatalogProduct.id` |
| `variant_id` | uuid, nullable | |
| `sku` | text, nullable | Snapshot |
| `name` | text | Snapshot — survives the product being renamed or deleted |
| `option_values` | jsonb, nullable | `Record<string, string>` snapshot |
| `quantity` | numeric(16,4) | |
| `quantity_unit` | text, nullable | |
| `uom_snapshot` | jsonb, nullable | Maps to `SalesLineUomSnapshot` |
| `unit_price_net` | numeric(16,4), nullable | Snapshot |
| `unit_price_gross` | numeric(16,4), nullable | Snapshot |
| `tax_rate` | numeric(7,4), nullable | Snapshot |
| `price_kind_id` | uuid, nullable | Which kind produced the snapshot |
| `price_row_id` | uuid, nullable | Which `CatalogProductPrice` won — explainability |
| `price_tier_min_quantity` | integer, nullable | The tier in force; a quantity change crossing it forces a re-price |
| `priced_at` | timestamptz | Snapshot stamp |
| `line_totals` | jsonb | Verbatim `SalesLineCalculationResult` |
| `availability_state` | text, nullable | Advisory, from the last check |
| `availability_checked_at` | timestamptz, nullable | |
| `configuration` | jsonb, nullable | Personalization, engraving, B2B configurator output |
| `added_by` | text | `buyer \| agent \| merchant \| merge` |
| `metadata` | jsonb, nullable | |

Constraint: unique `(cart_id, product_id, variant_id, configuration_hash)` among non-deleted lines. `configuration_hash` is a stored generated column over `configuration`, so two identical products with different engraving are separate lines while two identical plain lines merge by quantity.

### 4.3 `CartPromotionApplication` (`cart_promotion_applications`)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `cart_id` | uuid | |
| `promotion_id` | uuid | `promotions.Promotion.id` |
| `code` | text, nullable | The entered code, if any |
| `code_reservation_id` | uuid, nullable | SPEC-055 reservation, released on cart expiry |
| `scope` | text | `order \| line` |
| `cart_line_id` | uuid, nullable | For line scope |
| `effect` | jsonb | Resolved effect as returned by `promotionsService` |
| `amount_net` / `amount_gross` | numeric(16,4), nullable | |
| `applied_at` | timestamptz | |

### 4.4 `CartMergeLog` (`cart_merge_logs`)

Append-only. Records every merge so a lost basket can be reconstructed.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `source_cart_id` / `target_cart_id` | uuid | |
| `strategy` | text | `sum \| replace \| keep_target \| manual` |
| `source_snapshot` | jsonb | Full source lines before the merge |
| `outcome` | jsonb | Per-line disposition and reason |
| `merged_by_customer_user_id` | uuid, nullable | |

Without this log, "my basket disappeared when I logged in" is unanswerable. With it, it is a support query and, if needed, a restore.

---

## 5) Pricing & Re-pricing

### 5.1 Snapshot

On add, and on every re-price, each line stores `unit_price_net`, `unit_price_gross`, `tax_rate`, `price_kind_id`, `price_row_id`, `price_tier_min_quantity` and `priced_at`. `price_row_id` exists so support can answer "why is this line 87 zł" by naming the row.

### 5.2 Re-pricing triggers

A cart re-prices when, and only when:

1. A line's quantity changes such that it crosses a `min_quantity` / `max_quantity` tier boundary — only the affected line
2. Buyer identity changes: login, logout, a group membership change, or a change to that customer's own assortment override (created, edited, deleted, or lapsing past its `valid_until`) altering `buyer_digest` — whole cart
3. Currency or locale changes — whole cart
4. A line snapshot is older than the staleness budget (default 30 minutes) and the cart is read — whole cart
5. Checkout requests a lock (spec 7) — whole cart, mandatory, never skipped
6. A promotion is applied or removed — effects only, not unit prices
7. An operator forces it through the admin cart view

It does **not** re-price on every read. A buyer refreshing the page five times sees a stable total.

### 5.3 Price change disclosure

When a re-price changes any line, the response carries a `priceChanges` array — old amount, new amount, reason, per line — and the cart records `last_price_change_at`. The client must show this; a total that changes without explanation reads as a bug or a dark pattern, and in a consumer context an undisclosed increase between basket and payment is a regulatory problem.

Re-pricing updates `updated_at` (the concurrency token, §8.1) but sets `versionBumpReason: 'repricing'` in the response, so a client that then submits its now-stale `updatedAt` gets a distinguishable answer rather than a bare conflict (R3). The distinguishing signal is response metadata attached whenever a mutation performed a repricing side effect — it works identically whether the underlying token is a timestamp or a counter, which is why dropping the `version` counter (§4.1) costs this behaviour nothing.

### 5.4 B2B quantity tiers

`catalogPricingService` is called with the line's actual quantity, so tier selection is automatic. The cart additionally exposes, per line, the next tier and the quantity needed to reach it:

```typescript
nextTier: { minQuantity: 100, unitAmount: 8.40, formatted: '8,40 zł', saving: '12%' } | null
```

This is the single highest-value B2B affordance on the read side, and it costs one extra row from a query already being made.

### 5.5 Quantity rules

`minOrderQuantity`, `maxOrderQuantity` and `quantityIncrement` come from the availability policy. A quantity violating an increment is **rejected with the nearest valid values offered**, not silently rounded — silent rounding on a pack-size field produces orders the buyer did not place.

---

## 6) Promotions

On every mutation that changes lines or quantities, and on code entry or removal, `cart` calls:

```typescript
const effects = await promotionsService.evaluate({
  cart: toPromotionCartContext(cart),
  codes: appliedCodes,
  buyer: { customerId, customerGroupIds, channelId },
})
```

`promotions` owns the rule tree, the three-pass engine and all discount arithmetic; it returns **resolved effects**. `cart` maps them to `SalesAdjustmentDraft[]` and passes them to `salesCalculationService`. The cart never computes a discount amount.

Not cached: the rule tree depends on the entire cart composition, so any cache key would be the cart itself.

Code reservations (SPEC-055) are taken at code entry and released on cart expiry, abandonment or code removal. A reservation outliving its cart is the leak that makes single-use codes unusable; the expiry sweeper releases them.

Spec 6 aligns SPEC-055's cart interaction API to these calls.

---

## 6a) Assortment Visibility (added 2026-09-06)

Applies the amendments [Buyer-Scoped Catalog Visibility](./2026-08-21-buyer-scoped-catalog-visibility.md) §0 records against this document. Without them, the cart is the hole in an otherwise-enforced control: `storefront-public-api.md` §3.3 gates every product-returning **read** behind `buildStorefrontProductScope`, and nothing here gated the **write**. A buyer, script or AI purchasing agent holding any product id could add a restricted product straight to a cart, and cart lines flow into `checkout` and `SalesOrder` creation per ADR-1/ADR-2 — so an invisible product was fully purchasable. That is R11 below, and it is the reason this section exists.

### 6a.1 Per-line check on add, update and bulk add

`cart.lines.add`, `cart.lines.update` and `cart.lines.bulkAdd` gain one input field:

```typescript
assortmentScope?: EffectiveAssortmentScope   // packages/shared/src/lib/catalog-visibility/
```

After loading the product for its existing name/sku snapshot (§4.2) and before persisting the line:

```typescript
if (cart.channel === 'storefront') {
  if (input.assortmentScope === undefined) {
    throw new ValidationError('assortment_scope_required_for_storefront_channel')   // 400
  }
  const scoped = { id: product.id, categoryIds: product.categoryIds, tagIds: product.tagIds }
  if (!matchesScope(scoped, input.assortmentScope)) {
    return rejectLine({ code: 'product_unavailable', lineId: existingLineId ?? null })
  }
}
```

The caller **supplies** the scope rather than `cart` re-deriving it: the storefront route that proxies here has already called `storeContextService.resolve()` for pricing, so it passes the same `buyer.assortmentScope` through unchanged. This matches ADR-7 ("resolved once, at the edge") and keeps `cart` free of any new dependency on `ecommerce` or `customer_groups` beyond the `resolveTerms()` edge §3.1 already declares. Making the field **required when `channel === 'storefront'`** — validated, not merely optional — turns "the route layer forgot to pass it" into a `400` here rather than a silent bypass.

Rejection is a **non-fatal warning**, matching §10.1's existing convention for an out-of-stock line: the line is not added (or, for `.update`, the change is rejected and the line stays at its prior state), the request itself does not error, and `warnings` carries the code — which is what lets `bulkAdd` succeed partially across 50 lines.

### 6a.2 Whole-cart re-visibility pass at triggers 2 and 5

A per-line check alone leaves a time-of-check/time-of-use window: `CustomerGroupMembership.valid_until` is a first-class feature (spec 1 §5.2), so a buyer can legitimately add a Wholesale-only product while a member, have the membership lapse, and reach checkout with a line that was never re-checked.

So the re-pricing triggers in §5.2 that already run **whole-cart** carry a parallel re-*visibility* pass against the freshly-resolved scope:

- **Trigger 2** (buyer identity changes: login, logout, group membership change, per-customer assortment override change) — the case that produces the drift.
- **Trigger 5** (checkout requests a lock; "mandatory, never skipped") — the backstop.

A line that fails is **not deleted**. Deleting a buyer's line without disclosure is the failure class R2 and R4 already exist to prevent, and this does not add a third instance of it. The line is flagged `product_unavailable` in `warnings`, exactly as an out-of-stock line already is, and **the `active → locked` transition is refused while any line carries that flag** (§9) — mirroring the existing precedent that an over-`approval_required_above` cart cannot lock. The buyer removes or replaces the line, or regains access and re-triggers a re-price, before checkout proceeds.

### 6a.3 No write-side enumeration oracle

A restricted product and a nonexistent or deleted product id produce the **identical** `product_unavailable` warning — same body, same shape. This is `storefront-public-api.md` §4.2's handle-enumeration rule applied to a mutation: the read path goes to the trouble of collapsing "restricted" and "nonexistent" into one indistinguishable 404, and the write path must not hand that distinction back.

### 6a.4 Non-storefront channels are exempt by construction

The rule is keyed on **whether a scope was resolved**, not on an enumerated channel list: enforcement applies exactly to carts whose channel resolved a `StoreContext`, which today is `storefront` alone. `pos`, `pay_link`, `agent` and `api` carts have no channel binding and no buyer digest, so there is nothing to check against. A future channel that gains `StoreContext` resolution inherits enforcement automatically. An in-store POS sale by staff is a deliberately different trust boundary — assortment scope is a self-service merchandising control, not a sales permission.

---

## 7) Guest → Customer Merge

The hardest correctness question in the module, because every strategy is wrong for some buyer.

### 7.1 Policy

On login with both an active guest cart and an existing customer cart:

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Customer cart empty | Adopt the guest cart: reassign ownership, re-price, done |
| Guest cart empty | Keep the customer cart; discard the guest cart |
| Both non-empty, disjoint lines | Union |
| Both non-empty, same product+variant+configuration | `sum` by default, capped at `maxOrderQuantity` |
| Conflict on a configured line | Keep both as separate lines |

Default strategy is `sum`, configurable per store. Every merge writes a `CartMergeLog` with the full pre-merge source snapshot.

### 7.2 Disclosure and reversal

After a merge the response carries `mergeSummary` — lines added, quantities combined, anything capped. The UI must surface it. `POST /carts/:token/undo-merge` restores the pre-merge state from the log within 15 minutes.

**Rejected alternative:** silently replacing the customer cart with the guest cart. It is the simplest rule and it deletes a basket the buyer assembled on another device, with no trace.

### 7.3 Re-pricing after merge

Mandatory and whole-cart — the buyer's group has just become known, so every line's price may change. This is exactly the case that trigger 2 exists for, and it is also the case most likely to surprise, so `priceChanges` matters most here.

---

## 8) Concurrency & Idempotency

### 8.1 Optimistic locking (fixed 2026-08-17 — see §4.1)

Every mutating command starts with `enforceCommandOptimisticLock({ resourceKind: 'cart.cart', resourceId: cart.id, current: cart.updatedAt, request: ctx.request })` (`packages/shared/src/lib/crud/optimistic-lock-command.ts`) — the same mechanism every other command-driven write in this platform uses, not a bespoke conditional SQL update. The client sends its expected `updatedAt` via the standard `x-om-ext-optimistic-lock-expected-updated-at` header (or as a typed `updatedAt` field on the mutation body); the helper throws a `409` with the platform's standard `{ error, code, currentUpdatedAt, expectedUpdatedAt }` body on mismatch — the same shape every other conflict-bar-integrated surface in the admin UI already understands.

**Cart adds one thing on top, not instead of, that mechanism**: the `409` response body also embeds the full current `CartView` (§10.1) alongside the standard fields, so the client can reconcile without a second round trip — this was always additive to the platform's own conflict contract, never a reason to bypass it.

The lock check runs before any entity manager work; the entity mutations themselves run inside `withAtomicFlush(em, phases, { transaction: true, label: 'cart.<op>' })` (§3.1a) — not a raw SQL `UPDATE ... WHERE`, because the write flow interleaves external service calls (`catalogPricingService`, `promotionsService`, `salesCalculationService`) with entity mutations, which is exactly the "mutate → external work → mutate again" shape `withAtomicFlush` exists to protect against a dropped scalar update.

### 8.2 Idempotency

Mutations accept an `Idempotency-Key`. A repeated key within the cart's lifetime returns the original result without re-applying — this is what makes "add to cart" safe under a double-tap or a retried request on a flaky mobile connection.

Keys are stored per cart with the resulting `updatedAt` and a response digest. A key replayed with a different body returns `422 idempotency_key_mismatch`.

### 8.3 Token security

The token is the only credential for an anonymous cart. Therefore: 32+ bytes of CSPRNG entropy; never in a URL path that could land in a referrer or a log (it is a header or an httpOnly cookie); rotated on merge so a guest token cannot address the merged customer cart afterwards; and rate-limited per token to blunt enumeration.

| `active → abandoned` | No activity for 24 h (configurable); emits an event for recovery flows |
| `abandoned → active` | Any mutation; extends `expires_at` |
| `active → expired` | `expires_at` reached (default 30 days for identified buyers, 7 for guests); releases promotion code reservations |
| `* → merged` | Login merge; `merged_into_cart_id` set |

A `locked` cart that a client tries to mutate returns `423 Locked` with the checkout session id, not a generic error — the client needs to know to send the buyer back to checkout.

## 10) API Contracts

Base `/api/cart`. Token-bound, public with an optional buyer session. Every mutating route accepts the expected `updatedAt` (via the standard optimistic-lock header or a typed body field — §8.1) and `Idempotency-Key`. The three line-mutating routes additionally carry `assortmentScope`, required for storefront-channel carts (§6a.1).

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/carts` | Create; returns token + `updatedAt` |
| GET | `/carts/:token` | Read; re-prices only if stale (trigger 4) |
| POST | `/carts/:token/lines` | Add line |
| PATCH | `/carts/:token/lines/:lineId` | Change quantity or configuration |
| DELETE | `/carts/:token/lines/:lineId` | Remove line |
| POST | `/carts/:token/lines/bulk` | Batch add — reorder, quick-order pad, agent proposals |
| PATCH | `/carts/:token` | Email, note, locale, currency |
| POST | `/carts/:token/promotions` | Apply code |
| DELETE | `/carts/:token/promotions/:id` | Remove |
| POST | `/carts/:token/merge` | Merge a guest cart into the session's cart |
| POST | `/carts/:token/undo-merge` | Reverse within 15 min |
| POST | `/carts/:token/reprice` | Force re-price |
| POST | `/carts/:token/request-approval` | B2B; creates a `CustomerPurchaseApproval` |

`/carts/:token/lines/bulk` exists because B2B quick-order pads and agent proposals add 50 lines at once, and 50 sequential mutations means 50 promotion evaluations and 50 version conflicts.

### 10.1 Response

Every endpoint returns the same envelope, so a client has one parser:

```typescript
{
  cart: {
    token: string; updatedAt: string; status: CartStatus
    currencyCode: string; locale: string; taxMode: 'gross' | 'net'
    lines: CartLineView[]
    totals: SalesDocumentAmounts
    promotions: AppliedPromotionView[]
    requiresApproval: boolean
    approval: { id: string; status: string } | null
    itemCount: number; lineCount: number
    expiresAt: string
  }
  priceChanges?: PriceChange[]
  mergeSummary?: MergeSummary
  versionBumpReason?: 'mutation' | 'repricing' | 'merge'
  warnings?: Array<{ code: string; lineId?: string; message: string }>
}
```

`warnings` carries non-fatal conditions — a line that went out of stock, a promotion that stopped applying, a quantity capped. These must not be errors (they should not block the buyer) and must not be silent.

### 10.2 Admin

`GET /api/cart/carts` and `/carts/:id` under `cart.carts.view` — an abandoned-cart list with buyer, value and age. Read-only; support may inspect and force a re-price but not edit a buyer's basket.

### 10.3 ACL

```typescript
export const features = [
  { id: 'cart.carts.view',    title: 'View carts' },
  { id: 'cart.carts.manage',  title: 'Manage carts (reprice, expire)' },
  { id: 'cart.settings.manage', title: 'Manage cart settings' },
]
```

## 11) Events

```typescript
'cart.cart.created' | '.updated' | '.expired' | '.abandoned' | '.merged' | '.converted'
'cart.line.added' | '.updated' | '.removed'
'cart.promotion.applied' | '.removed' | '.no_longer_valid'
'cart.price.changed'          // payload: per-line old/new and reason
'cart.approval.requested'
'cart.lock.acquired' | '.released' | '.timed_out'
'cart.line.visibility_rejected'   // added 2026-09-06 — §6a
```

`cart.line.visibility_rejected` carries `{ cartId, productId, variantId, reason: 'not_in_assortment', triggeredBy: 'add' | 'update' | 'bulkAdd' | 'reprice' | 'checkout_lock' }` and is emitted by both enforcement points (§6a.1, §6a.2). It is **not** `clientBroadcast` — the buyer already sees the `product_unavailable` warning in the response body; this is the operator-facing signal, so a merchant who narrows a group's `assortment_scope` too far, or misconfigures a channel's `require_authentication`, sees a trend instead of scattered support tickets. Same reasoning as `availability.shortfall.detected` and `customer_groups.credit.limit_exceeded`.

`cart.cart.abandoned` is the hook for recovery flows (out of scope here). `cart.price.changed` feeds analytics on how often snapshots go stale, which is how the staleness budget gets tuned with evidence.

`clientBroadcast: true` on line and totals events so a second tab updates via the DOM Event Bridge instead of polling.

## 12) Background Jobs

| Job | Cadence | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `mark-abandoned-carts` | every 15 min | `active` → `abandoned` past the inactivity window |
| `expire-carts` | hourly | Expire past TTL; release promotion code reservations |
| `release-stale-locks` | every 5 min | `locked` → `active` past the lock timeout |
| `purge-expired-carts` | daily | Hard-delete carts expired more than 90 days ago, retaining the merge log |

## 13) Risks & Impact Review

| # | Risk | Severity | Area | Failure scenario | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Cart and order totals diverge | **Critical** | `cart`, `sales` | The cart rounds a tax amount differently from the order it produces; the buyer accepts 123,00 zł and is invoiced 123,45 zł. Consumer-law exposure and a reconciliation problem on every affected order. | ADR-2: all arithmetic through `salesCalculationService`; totals stored verbatim; a property-based test over the tax-rate matrix asserts cart totals equal order totals for the same lines — a Phase 2 gate | Low |
| R2 | Guest cart silently destroyed on login | **High** | `cart` | A buyer assembles a basket on mobile, logs in, and a `replace` merge deletes the desktop cart they were about to buy. Unrecoverable and invisible. | Documented policy (§7.1) defaulting to `sum`; `CartMergeLog` retains the full pre-merge snapshot; `mergeSummary` disclosed; 15-minute undo | Low |
| R3 | Re-pricing indistinguishable from a conflict | Medium | `cart` | The server re-prices on read, bumping the version; the client's next mutation 409s though nothing concurrent happened. Repeated, it looks like a broken cart. | `versionBumpReason: 'repricing'`; the 409 body embeds the current cart so the client reconciles in one round trip; re-price on read only past the staleness budget | Low |
| R4 | Undisclosed price increase | **High** | `cart`, legal | A promotion expires between add and checkout; the total rises silently and the buyer pays more than they agreed. | `priceChanges` on every response where a snapshot changed; `cart.price.changed` event; spec 10 requires the UI to surface it; checkout re-prices and must re-confirm | Low |
| R5 | Promotion evaluation cost | Medium | `cart`, `promotions` | Every mutation evaluates the full rule tree; a 50-line B2B quick order triggers 50 evaluations. | `/lines/bulk` evaluates once for the batch; SPEC-055's lightweight product-page variant used where a full pass is not needed; evaluation latency budgeted at P95 < 150 ms for a 50-line cart | Medium — depends on SPEC-055's engine performance, measured at the Phase 2 gate |
| R6 | Cart token leakage | **High** | `cart` | A token in a URL path reaches referrer headers, server logs and analytics; anyone holding it reads and mutates the basket, including the buyer's email. | 32+ byte CSPRNG token; header or httpOnly cookie only, never a path segment; rotated on merge; per-token rate limit; `email` encrypted at rest | Low |
| R7 | Stale availability accepted at checkout | Medium | `cart`, `availability` | A line marked `in_stock` 30 minutes ago is out of stock at submit; checkout fails after payment details are entered. | Availability in the cart is explicitly advisory; checkout re-checks and reserves at submit (availability spec §7); `warnings` surfaces a line that went out of stock on any read | Medium — inherent to reserve-at-checkout, and disclosed |
| R8 | Orphaned promotion code reservations | Medium | `cart`, `promotions` | Abandoned carts hold single-use code reservations; a limited campaign exhausts against baskets nobody bought. | Expiry sweeper releases reservations; abandonment releases them ahead of full expiry; reservation TTL is independent of and shorter than cart TTL | Low |
| R9 | Silent quantity rounding | Medium | `cart` | A pack-size increment of 6 silently rounds a request for 7 up to 12; the buyer receives and is billed for twice what they wanted. | Rejected with nearest valid values offered, never rounded (§5.5) | Low |
| R10 | Unbounded cart growth | Low | `cart` | A script adds 100 000 lines; promotion evaluation and totals become a denial of service. | 200 lines per cart, 10 000 units per line; per-token rate limit; batch endpoint capped at 100 lines per call | Low |
| R11 | Write path bypasses read-side assortment visibility | **Critical** | `cart` | A product hidden from browsing is still purchasable: a buyer, script or AI agent holding a product id (a stale link, a scraped sitemap, an id from an unrelated source) `POST`s it to `/carts/:token/lines`, and the line flows through `checkout` into a `SalesOrder`. A read-side 404 that a cart mutation ignores is a suggestion, not a control. | §6a.1: `assortmentScope` is a validated, required input on `lines.add`/`.update`/`.bulkAdd` for storefront-channel carts — omission is a `400`, not a silent pass-through; §6a.2's whole-cart pass at triggers 2 and 5 closes the time-of-check/time-of-use window a lapsing membership opens, with the checkout lock refused while a line is flagged | Low once shipped — the residual is a future cart mutation forgetting the same check, mitigated by §6a.4's channel-keyed rule rather than an enumerated list |
| R12 | Write-side rejection becomes its own enumeration oracle | Medium | `cart` | A distinguishable "restricted" vs "not found" response lets a script map a private assortment through cart-add attempts — the write-side analogue of `storefront-public-api.md` R4. | §6a.3: identical `product_unavailable` warning for both cases, asserted by test | Low |

---

## 14) Integration Coverage

**Totals correctness (Phase 2 gate):**
- Cart totals equal the totals of the `SalesOrder` produced from the same lines, across a tax matrix including compound rates, mixed rates within a cart, and rounding boundaries (R1)
- Totals stored verbatim; no re-rounding on read
- Order-scope promotion effects reach `salesCalculationService` as `SalesAdjustmentDraft`, line- and unit-scope effects as `SalesLineSnapshot.discountAmount` carrying `|amount| / lineQuantity`, and both are reflected in totals (SPEC-055 §B.6)
- A partially covered line (`appliedQuantity < lineQuantity`) discounts `unitAmount × appliedQuantity`, not `unitAmount × lineQuantity` — asserted in all three directions (correct mapping, `unitAmount` assigned directly, raw `amount` assigned) so neither mis-mapping can pass (SPEC-055 A-R6 / `TC-PROM-060`)
- Where `lineQuantity` does not divide `|amount|` evenly, the byte-identical-totals assertion above compares document totals; the effect's `amount` may differ from the realised discount by up to the 4 dp rounding step

**Pricing:**
- Snapshot stable across repeated reads within the staleness budget
- Each of the seven triggers re-prices, and no other action does
- Crossing a `min_quantity` boundary re-prices that line only
- `nextTier` correct, absent at the top tier
- Personal customer price beats group price beats channel default
- `price_row_id` names the winning row
- `priceChanges` populated on every change, absent otherwise (R4)

**Concurrency:**
- Two clients presenting the same `updatedAt`: one succeeds, one gets 409 (standard `enforceCommandOptimisticLock` body) with the current cart additionally embedded
- Repeated `Idempotency-Key` returns the original result without re-applying
- Same key with a different body returns 422
- Re-pricing bump carries `versionBumpReason: 'repricing'` (R3)
- 20 parallel add-line calls yield a consistent final quantity

**Merge:**
- All five §7.1 situations
- `CartMergeLog` captures the full pre-merge source
- `undo-merge` restores within 15 minutes, refuses after
- Post-merge re-price applied and disclosed
- Token rotated; the old guest token no longer resolves (R6)

**B2B:**
- Quantity increment violation rejected with nearest valid values (R9)
- Below `minOrderQuantity` rejected; above `maxOrderQuantity` capped with a warning
- Over `approval_required_above` sets `requiresApproval` and blocks the checkout lock
- Net tax mode from group terms reflected in totals

**Assortment visibility (R11/R12 regression suite, §6a):**
- `lines.add` with a restricted product and a correctly-supplied `assortmentScope`: rejected with `product_unavailable`; totals unaffected
- `lines.add` on a `storefront`-channel cart with `assortmentScope` omitted: `400 assortment_scope_required_for_storefront_channel`, no line added
- `lines.bulkAdd` mixing visible and restricted products: visible ones added, restricted ones reported per-line in `warnings`, no whole-batch failure
- `lines.update` on a line whose product has since become restricted: rejected, the existing line untouched and **not** deleted, `lineId` populated in the warning
- `pos`/`pay_link`/`agent`/`api` carts: no `assortmentScope` required, no rejection regardless of storefront assortment status (§6a.4)
- **The TOCTOU fixture:** add a line while the buyer is a member of a scoped group, expire the membership, request the checkout lock (trigger 5) — the lock is refused while the line is flagged, and the line is still present
- A membership change mid-session (trigger 2) runs the same whole-cart pass without waiting for checkout
- A restricted and a nonexistent product id produce identical `lines.add` responses in body and timing (R12)
- `cart.line.visibility_rejected` emitted from both enforcement points with the correct `triggeredBy`

**Lifecycle:**
- Lock forces a re-price; mutation while locked returns 423 with the session id
- Lock timeout returns the cart to active
- Abandonment and expiry transitions; expiry releases code reservations (R8)
- Limits enforced (R10)

**API:** every route, with tenant isolation and cross-tenant token rejection.

## 15) Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 — Core cart
Entities, token generation, line CRUD, snapshots, `salesCalculationService` totals, optimistic locking, idempotency, TTL and sweepers.

**Gate:** the totals-equivalence property test passes; concurrency tests pass.

### Phase 2 — Pricing behaviour
Trigger set, `priceChanges` disclosure, quantity tiers and `nextTier`, quantity rules, availability advisory and warnings.

**Gate:** each trigger verified in isolation; no re-price outside the set.

### Phase 3 — Promotions and merge
`promotionsService` integration, code application and reservations, merge policy, `CartMergeLog`, undo.

**Gate:** merge covers all five situations with a restorable log; reservations released on expiry.

### Phase 4 — B2B and admin
Approval routing, bulk lines, admin cart list, abandonment events.

**Gate:** an over-threshold cart cannot lock until approved; a 100-line bulk add evaluates promotions once.

## 16) Open Questions

1. **Saved carts / multiple named carts** — B2B buyers maintain recurring order templates. The model supports it (a `name` column and a `saved` status), but the UX belongs to spec 9. *Deferred; not built speculatively.* **Closed 2026-09-16:** spec 9 split the two meanings that "template" conflated — a parked basket is a saved cart, resumed once (and merged via the existing `cart.merge`/`cart.mergeUndo` when the buyer already holds one), while a reusable named set of products and quantities is a shopping list owned by `customer_accounts`. A copy-a-cart-into-a-new-cart primitive was briefly flagged against §3.1a as a gap; it is withdrawn — no new `cart` command is required.
2. **Cross-store carts** — scoped to one store per the roadmap. Revisit if a tenant wants a shared basket across storefronts.
3. **Cart-level currency switching** — currently re-prices the whole cart. Whether a buyer may switch currency mid-cart at all, or must start over, is a merchandising decision. *Assumed re-price is acceptable.*
4. **Agent-authored carts** — `added_by: 'agent'` is in the model. Whether an AI-proposed line needs explicit buyer confirmation before it counts toward totals is an approval-contract question for the AI framework. *Reserved, not specified.*

## 17) Final Compliance Report

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| No cross-module ORM relations | All references are FK ids; catalog, promotions, availability, sales and groups reached through DI services |
| No reimplemented arithmetic | ADR-2 enforced; totals stored verbatim; property test gates it |
| Tenant/organization scoping | Every entity and query; cross-tenant token resolution rejected |
| Optimistic locking | `updated_at` via `enforceCommandOptimisticLock` (§8.1, fixed 2026-08-17 — no `version` counter; the platform's helper is hard-coded to timestamp comparison and cannot accept one), distinguishable re-price bumps via `versionBumpReason` |
| Command pattern | Every mutation is a registered command (§3.1a, fixed 2026-08-17 — an earlier draft described plain HTTP handlers with no command wiring at all) |
| Encryption | `email` declared in `cart/encryption.ts`'s `defaultEncryptionMaps` (`entityId: 'cart:cart'`); reads via `findWithDecryption` |
| Zod validation | All routes; `z.infer` types |
| No `any` | Service and payload contracts fully typed |
| i18n | Warning and error codes translated; no hard-coded user-facing strings |
| Rate limiting | Per token and per IP on public mutation routes |
| Queue usage | Sweepers via the `queue` worker contract, not custom timers |
| Events | `createModuleEvents`; `clientBroadcast` on line and totals events |
| Backward compatibility | New module; no existing contract surface changes. `SalesDocumentKind` deliberately **not** extended |
| Integration coverage | §14, shipping in the same change |

## 18) Changelog

### 2026-09-16 (rev 6 — per-customer assortment overrides reach trigger 2)

Applied from [Buyer-Scoped Catalog Visibility](./2026-08-21-buyer-scoped-catalog-visibility.md) §3.6/§6.2. That spec now resolves catalog visibility per customer as well as per group, and a per-customer override carries its own `valid_until` exactly as a group membership does.

- §5.2 trigger 2 and §9's restatement of it now read "buyer identity changes: login, logout, a group membership change, **or a change to that customer's own assortment override**". Without that clause the override would have been the one buyer-side change that reaches the checkout lock unchecked — R7's shape, reintroduced through a new column rather than through the original TOCTOU window. No change to §6a's check itself: it consumes a resolved `EffectiveAssortmentScope` and has never known how many sources produced it.

### 2026-09-09 (rev 5 — the per-unit discount contract stated correctly)

Rev 4's §3 rule 1 was specified against a `sales` API that does not exist. It mandated `discountAmountBasis: 'line'` and attributed the behaviour to `resolveLineDiscountTotal` in `sales/lib/calculations.ts`; neither identifier occurs anywhere in the repository. `SalesLineSnapshot` (`packages/core/src/modules/sales/lib/types.ts:35-63`) has no basis field, and `buildBaseLineResult` (`calculations.ts:80-123`) reads `discountAmount` as `discountPerUnit` and multiplies it by the line's full `quantity` unconditionally — the one basis rev 4 forbade, with no way to opt out. Followed as written, `cart` would have assigned the effect's total and discounted it `lineQuantity` times over: on SPEC-055 TC-PROM-065(a)'s figures, a 200.00 line free against an intended 40.00.

- §3 rule 1: replaced with the real contract — `discountAmount = |amount| / lineQuantity` (the line's **full** quantity, not `appliedQuantity`), with both mis-mappings and their arithmetic named, and the sub-cent rounding residual stated.
- §14: acceptance criteria restated against that mapping, the partial-coverage assertion widened from two directions to three, and the rounding gap called out against the byte-identical-totals gate.

### 2026-09-07 (rev 4 — promotion effect mapping corrected)

Applied [SPEC-055](./SPEC-055-2026-02-23-promotions-module.md) §B.6. This document previously said promotion effects "map onto adjustment drafts" wholesale — a mapping the `sales` module rejects: `SalesAdjustmentDraft` carries no line reference, and `documents.ts` throws `400 "Line-scoped adjustments are not supported yet."` when a line-attributed draft arrives. Left as written, every per-line promotion would have either failed at order creation or silently detached its discount from the line.

- §3: promotion effects now **split by target** — only `appliesTo: 'order'` effects become `SalesAdjustmentDraft`; `LINE_DISCOUNT` (targets `line` and `unit`) becomes `SalesLineSnapshot.discountAmount` on the matching line. Added the three binding rules: the per-unit amount (mis-stated here as a basis flag, corrected in rev 5), positive magnitude on a net basis with gross→net conversion, and summation of cumulative promotions into the single line scalar with attribution deferred to `PromotionUsage.effects_snapshot`.
- §14: split the promotion-adjustment acceptance criterion by target, and added the partial-coverage totals assertion (widened in rev 5) (SPEC-055 A-R6 / `TC-PROM-060`).

### 2026-09-06 (rev 3 — sibling amendments applied)

Applied the amendments [Buyer-Scoped Catalog Visibility](./2026-08-21-buyer-scoped-catalog-visibility.md) §0 records against this document. Leaving them pending in a sibling file would have meant this spec — the one that actually owns the `cart` module, and reads as complete — specifying the write path with no visibility check at all, which is the Critical hole that document exists to close.

- Added **§6a Assortment Visibility**: the per-line check on `lines.add`/`.update`/`.bulkAdd` with a validated, storefront-required `assortmentScope` input (§6a.1); the whole-cart re-visibility pass at re-pricing triggers 2 and 5 closing the membership-lapse TOCTOU window (§6a.2); the no-enumeration-oracle rejection shape (§6a.3); and the channel-keyed exemption rule for `pos`/`pay_link`/`agent`/`api` (§6a.4).
- §9: the `active → locked` transition now runs the re-visibility pass and is **refused** while any line carries an unresolved `product_unavailable` warning — mirroring the existing `requiresApproval`-blocks-lock precedent.
- §11: added `cart.line.visibility_rejected`, operator-facing, not `clientBroadcast`.
- §13: added R11 (write path bypasses read-side visibility, **Critical**) and R12 (write-side enumeration oracle, Medium).
- §14: added the R11/R12 regression suite, including the membership-expiry-then-checkout-lock fixture.

No entity or column changes to `cart`. The new command input is an additive field on an unimplemented command signature.

### 2026-08-17 (rev 2 — pre-implementation fixes)

Fixed two Critical findings from a `/om-pre-implement-spec` audit (`ANALYSIS-2026-08-14-cart-module.md`):

- **`Cart.version: integer` removed.** The original draft carried forward SPEC-029 v3's already-superseded "version optimistic locking" reasoning instead of this platform's actual mechanism — the same mistake already made and fixed in the sibling `customer-groups-and-b2b-terms.md` spec. `packages/shared/src/lib/crud/optimistic-lock-command.ts`'s `enforceCommandOptimisticLock` is hard-coded to `updated_at`/ISO-timestamp comparison and cannot accept a generic counter. Fixed: `Cart.updatedAt` is the sole concurrency token (§4.1, §8.1); the 409 body still embeds the full current cart as an addition on top of the platform's standard conflict shape, losing no client-facing behaviour.
- **Command pattern wiring added.** The original draft described every cart mutation as a plain HTTP handler with a raw conditional SQL update — no `registerCommand`, no undo, no `withAtomicFlush`. Added §3.1a naming every mutation as a registered command, and rewrote §8.1's write flow as lock pre-check → `withAtomicFlush` → post-commit side effects, mirroring `sales/commands/documents.ts`.
- Added the missing `cart/encryption.ts` declaration backing §17's `email`-encryption claim.

### 2026-08-14
- Initial specification, replacing SPEC-029 v3 §7.4's cart-as-checkout-session model per ADR-1.
- Grounded in the implemented `sales` calculation contract: `SalesCalculationService.calculateDocumentTotals({ documentKind, lines, adjustments, context })`, with `SalesLineSnapshot` already carrying `productId`, `productVariantId`, `quantity`, `uomSnapshot`, `unitPriceNet`/`Gross`, `discountAmount`, `taxRate`, `configuration` and `promotionCode`, and `SalesAdjustmentDraft` already carrying `scope`, `promotionId` and net/gross amounts — so cart lines and promotion effects map onto the existing shapes without a parallel model.
- Chose `documentKind: 'quote'` over extending `SalesDocumentKind` (`'order' | 'quote' | 'invoice' | 'credit_memo'`), avoiding ripple into document sequences, search indexing and the documents table.
- Carried forward v3's idempotency and optimistic-locking reasoning (v3 §7.5), extending it with a distinguishable re-price version bump, which v3 did not anticipate because its cart never re-priced.
- Added the re-pricing trigger set, price-change disclosure, the merge policy with an append-only log and undo, and B2B quantity-tier behaviour — none of which existed in v3.
