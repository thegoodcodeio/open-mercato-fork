# NOTIFY — Catalog Bulk-Create (Products & Categories)

## 2026-08-25T17:30:00Z — run complete: reviewed, finalized, lock released

Steps 8-10 done. Review found no blockers/majors; formal GitHub approval was blocked (self-approval), posted as a PR comment instead. PR body flipped to `Status: complete`, promoted draft → ready, labels normalized (`priority-medium`, `risk-low`, `skip-qa`, `review` — stays `review` pending an independent approval, not `merge-queue`, precisely because this automation couldn't self-approve). Comprehensive summary comment posted. `in-progress` lock released below. Nothing further pending from this automation; next action is a human/independent-agent review approval plus confirming the two integration specs actually pass.

## 2026-08-25T16:45:00Z — Step 7 final gate done; integration tests added but unexecuted

- Added `TC-CAT-036`/`TC-CAT-037` integration specs for both bulk-create endpoints (commit `c3249bb43`), following the `customers` module's `TC-CRM-068` queue-drain/progress-poll precedent. Required by AGENTS.md's "integration coverage ships in the same change" rule; previously only unit-level (mocked commandBus) coverage existed.
- Full `validation.commands` gate clean (8/8 steps); `yarn lint` clean. Detail in `final-gate-checks.md`.
- **Gap disclosed, not hidden**: the two new specs were not run against a live app this pass — no dev server/ephemeral env available, and a `playwright --list` attempt hung (killed after several minutes rather than debugged further, given no environment was standing). Flagged in HANDOFF.md and will be flagged in the PR summary comment for the reviewer/CI to pick up.
- Also noticed and fixed mid-gate: retroactively applied the `in-progress` claim label + comment for this resume, which had been skipped at the start of this session (step 1 of the skill) — the PR was otherwise correctly labeled/assigned from the prior resume's release.
- Status remains `in-progress`, PR stays draft. Next: Step 8 (`om-auto-review-pr --autofix`).

## 2026-08-25T16:00:00Z — spec correction landed; all implementation/docs work done

- `.ai/specs/2026-08-25-catalog-bulk-create.md` corrected across TLDR, Resolved Assumptions, Proposed Solution, Architecture, Data Model, UI/UX, Edge Cases, Risks, Phasing, and Implementation Plan to describe what actually ships instead of the original (non-viable) identity-map pre-warm design. Commit `01b11ac39`.
- Also fixed products' bulk-create item cap: implementation had drifted to `.max(10000)` (copy-paste from categories); spec's own Resolved Assumption #9 and API Contracts always said 2000 for products. Fixed in the same commit; re-ran the affected unit tests, all pass.
- All Tasks-table rows are now `done`. Next: Step 7 (final gate), Step 8 (review pass), Steps 9–10 (summary/labels/finalize).

## 2026-08-25T15:35:00Z — Phase 3 complete (3.1 verified no-op, 3.2 docs landed)

- Step 3.1: verified the plan's assumption (a `jobType` → i18n-label registry in `ProgressTopBar` needing new entries) doesn't match the actual architecture — `ProgressTopBar` renders `job.name`/`job.description` directly with no per-`jobType` branching anywhere in the progress module or UI package, and `jobType` is a free-form string, not an enum. Nothing to change; documented in HANDOFF.md.
- Step 3.2: added `/api/catalog/products/bulk-create` and `/api/catalog/categories/bulk-create` subsections to `apps/docs/docs/api/catalog.mdx`, matching the file's existing style.
- All of Phase 1, 2, and 3 are now `done` in PLAN.md's Tasks table. Remaining before the final gate: the spec-correction commit to `.ai/specs/2026-08-25-catalog-bulk-create.md`.
- Status remains `in-progress`, PR stays draft.

## 2026-08-25T15:10:00Z — checkpoint 2 — Steps 1.3, 2.1–2.4

- Landed: Step 1.3 (categories event-emission test), Phase 2 in full (2.1 worker+lib, 2.2 route+validators, 2.3 redefined pre-validation assertions, 2.4 checkpoint/resume parity) — products bulk-create mirrors Phase 1 exactly, pre-validation only, per the final operator decision on reference-data caching.
- Commits: `012e1ad94`, `b588e2cc4`, `5e356dd46`, `0db68c727`.
- Validation: `generate`, `build:packages`, `typecheck` (27/27), `test catalog` (1437/1438 suites — same pre-existing Polish-locale failure as checkpoint 1), `eslint` on every new/changed file, `i18n:check-hardcoded` (catalog module not flagged) — all clean. Full detail in `checkpoint-2-checks.md`.
- No UI touched — no screenshots this checkpoint.
- Status remains `in-progress`, PR stays draft. Next: Phase 3 (i18n/docs), the spec-correction commit, then the final gate and review pass.

## 2026-08-25T14:05:00Z — operator decision: drop products memoization goal, correct the spec

Final decision on the reference-data caching question (after two prior attempts at a narrower fix both turned out non-viable): drop the memoization goal for products entirely (option 2), and correct `.ai/specs/2026-08-25-catalog-bulk-create.md`'s Architecture/Risks sections to state the `fork()`-clears-identity-map finding as a permanent constraint rather than a risk to verify (option 3). Option 1 (editing `execute()`'s call sites in `commands/products.ts`) is rejected — no further edits to `commands/categories.ts`/`commands/products.ts` of any kind. Full concrete scope for Phase 2 and the spec correction recorded in `HANDOFF.md`. All three decision points on this topic are now closed; next resume proceeds Step 1.3 → Phase 2 (pre-validation only, corrected Step 2.3 test) → spec correction commit → Phase 3, with no further check-ins expected on this specific question.

## 2026-08-25T13:45:00Z — resume paused: the approved export-only plan turns out to be a no-op

Before implementing the approved memoization wrapper, traced how `createProductCommand.execute` actually calls `resolveScopedTaxRate`/`resolveProductUnitDefaults` (`commands/products.ts:1388/1415/1774/1811`) — they're called by direct, module-local function reference. `export`ing them (as approved) lets the worker `import` and wrap *its own copy*, but `execute()`'s own call sites still invoke the original unwrapped functions, so the worker's memoization cache is never consulted by the command and the DB round trips per row are unchanged. No production code was written against the approved plan once this was confirmed — writing the wrapper as approved would have been dead code that Step 2.3's own hit-rate assertion would have caught (~0% hit rate, same as if nothing were built), just later and more expensively.

Full corrected analysis and three regrounded options (genuinely edit the command's call sites with fresh sign-off / drop the memoization goal and keep pre-validation only / escalate as a spec-level finding) written to `HANDOFF.md`. Recommending option 2 (drop the goal) as the low-risk default, but leaving the call to the operator since the prior export-only recommendation itself turned out to be wrong. Status remains `in-progress`, PR stays draft. Step 1.3 remains the one pending item independent of this question.

## 2026-08-25T13:20:00Z — operator decision: approve export-only edit

The operator approved option 1 from the 2026-08-25T13:00:00Z decision point: add `export` to `resolveScopedTaxRate` and `resolveProductUnitDefaults` in `commands/products.ts` (purely additive visibility, no behavior/contract change), then build the batch-scoped memoization wrapper around them plus `requireOptionSchemaTemplate` in `lib/bulkCreateProducts.ts`. Both Phase-2-blocking decision points are now resolved. Next resume: land Step 1.3 (still pending), then proceed through Step 2.1 onward.

## 2026-08-25T13:00:00Z — resume paused: second decision point before Step 2.1

Started Step 2.1 per the operator's memoization-wrapper decision. Confirmed `resolveScopedTaxRate`/`resolveProductUnitDefaults` in `commands/products.ts` are separate, wrappable functions (not inlined) — but they are not `export`ed, so wrapping them requires adding `export` to `commands/products.ts` itself. That's a smaller edit than the rejected `.fork({clear:false})` change (no behavior/contract change, purely additive visibility), but it wasn't explicitly covered by the prior decision, which only cleared wrapping "without editing the command's own `execute()`". Stopped and documented full detail + two options in `HANDOFF.md` rather than deciding unilaterally. No code changed this pass; worktree still at commit `0e30d0e62`. Status remains `in-progress`, PR stays draft.

## 2026-08-25T12:30:00Z — operator decision: Phase 2 reference-data caching

The operator was presented all three options from the 2026-08-25T10:40:00Z architecture finding (memoization wrapper / `em.fork({clear:false})` command change / drop the optimization) and chose the **targeted memoization wrapper** (path 1). The `em.fork()` command change is explicitly rejected — `commands/categories.ts`/`commands/products.ts` stay untouched, Resolved Assumption #3 holds.

Next resume (starting Step 2.1) must first confirm `resolveScopedTaxRate`, `resolveProductUnitDefaults`, and the option-schema-template fetch are separately-callable helpers before wrapping them in a batch-scoped memoization cache. If they are inlined in the command with no extractable seam, stop and re-surface to the operator — do not fall back to the rejected command-change path or silently drop the optimization.

## 2026-08-25T12:00:00Z — resume ends, still in-progress

- Status: `in-progress`, PR stays draft. Steps 1.1, 1.2, 1.4 landed (commits `86d8beeee`..`b4c787c8e`); Step 1.3 (integration test, no new code) is the next `todo` row.
- Checkpoint 1 verification and the comprehensive resume summary were posted to PR #5610.
- Architecture finding surfaced to the operator (not resolved unilaterally): the spec's shared-EntityManager identity-map pre-warm does not reduce the create commands' own internal lookups given MikroORM's `fork()` clearing the identity map by default; Phase 2 needs a decision (memoization wrapper vs. a minimal, explicitly-approved command change) before Step 2.1 can credibly deliver the products-side DB-lookup reduction the spec leads with.
- Re-entry: `/om-auto-continue-pr-loop 5610`, starting at Step 1.3.

## 2026-08-25T10:35:00Z — om-auto-continue-pr-loop resume

- Resumed by: @adeptofvoltron
- Resume point: 1.1 (source: this is the PR's first implementation attempt — only the spec and a flat plan existed)
- PR head SHA: e12af46ad
- Action: migrated the legacy flat plan (`.ai/runs/2026-08-25-catalog-bulk-create.md`) into this run folder (`PLAN.md` + `Tasks` table + `HANDOFF.md` + `NOTIFY.md`) per the run-folder-lookup fallback for pre-folder-migration PRs.

## 2026-08-25T10:40:00Z — architecture finding: identity-map pre-warm does not reach the command's internal lookups

While implementing Step 1.2, verified (by reading this repo's installed `@mikro-orm/core` `ForkOptions` typedef) that `EntityManager.fork()` defaults `clear: true` — a **cleared** identity map, not an inherited one. `createCategoryCommand.execute` (and, per its structurally-identical code, `createProductCommand.execute`) call `(ctx.container.resolve('em') as EntityManager).fork()` with **no options**, so every row's command call gets a fresh, empty identity map regardless of what the worker pre-fetches into the container's own `em` beforehand. This repo also configures no MikroORM result cache (`packages/shared/src/lib/db/mikro.ts`), so there is no other layer that could turn a repeated lookup into a cache hit.

This is a more fundamental blocker than the risk the spec's Architecture section anticipated (a raw query-builder path bypassing the identity map) — it holds even when every lookup goes through `em.findOne`/`em.find`, because the identity map itself is discarded before the command's own lookups run. Given the create commands are contractually unchanged (Resolved Assumption #3), the shared-EntityManager pre-warm as literally designed in the spec **cannot** reduce the command-internal reference-data lookups (slug/parent-scope checks for categories; tax-rate/option-schema/unit-default lookups for products in Phase 2).

**Resolution taken for Phase 1:** the "pre-warm" step is implemented instead as a **batch pre-validation pass** — one `em.find` for distinct slugs and one for distinct parent IDs referenced across the batch, used to fail obviously-invalid rows before ever calling the command (real DB-round-trip savings for provably-bad rows), rather than as an (inert) identity-map warm-up. This is documented in a code comment at the top of the pre-warm block in `lib/bulkCreateCategories.ts`.

**Open question for Phase 2 (Step 2.3, "Identity-map hit-rate verification"):** the spec's own query-count assertion test will measure a 0% hit rate for `resolveScopedTaxRate`/`resolveProductUnitDefaults`/option-schema-template lookups under the current design. The spec's own sanctioned fallback is "a small, targeted memoization wrapper around just that lookup call" — viable if those are separately-callable helper functions (not yet confirmed), but does NOT apply to categories' inlined slug/parent checks (no extractable helper to wrap without touching the command itself, which Resolved Assumption #3 forbids). Flagging this for the operator/reviewer rather than deciding unilaterally to modify the create commands' own `.fork()` call, since that would touch a contract surface Resolved Assumption #3 explicitly protects.

## 2026-08-25T11:10:00Z — checkpoint durability note

`ProgressService.updateProgress` persists on an internal throttle (`HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` = 5000ms, or sooner on a >=1% progress change), not on every call — confirmed by reading `progressServiceImpl.ts`. This means the durably-persisted `meta.lastCompletedRowIndex` can lag further behind actual processing than the nominal 20-row `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL` would suggest, especially at the throughput the spec itself cites (~20-30 rows/sec). Implemented resume as a **dynamic boundary search** instead of assuming a fixed ~19-row replay window: on resume, every row from `lastCompletedRowIndex + 1` is pre-checked against its natural key (slug, or name+parentId) until the first row that was NOT already created by the prior attempt — since rows are created in array order, every row after that point is guaranteed genuinely new, so the pre-check stops there. This preserves the Edge Cases section's stated behavior (a replayed row is recognized and skipped, not duplicated or misreported as failed) regardless of how large the actual persisted-checkpoint lag turns out to be.

## 2026-08-25T11:40:00Z — checkpoint 1 — Steps 1.1-1.2 (+1.4, landed together)

- Step 1.1: `POST /api/catalog/categories/bulk-create` route + `categoriesBulkCreateSchema`/`categoryBulkCreateRowSchema` in `data/validators.ts`.
- Step 1.2: `lib/bulkCreateCategories.ts` (batch pre-validation, per-row command execution, per-row failure collection, cancellation cooperative check) + `workers/catalog-category-bulk-create.ts`. Checkpoint/resume (Step 1.4) is implemented in the same function — the row loop and its checkpoint bookkeeping are not separable into two independent diffs — so 1.4 is marked `done` against the same commit as 1.2; see the Tasks table.
- Validation run: `yarn generate`, `yarn build:packages` (x2, generate-then-rebuild order), `yarn typecheck` (27/27 packages pass), `yarn workspace @open-mercato/core test catalog` (1435/1436 suites pass; the one failing suite, `warranty_claims/__tests__/quantity.test.ts`, fails on this machine's Polish decimal-comma locale and is unrelated pre-existing drift — same class of failure already on file for this repo's local-machine test runs), `yarn eslint` on the four new/changed files (clean), `yarn i18n:check-hardcoded` (new files not flagged).
- Step 1.3 ("verify events/index fire per row unchanged") is explicitly a verification-only integration test per the spec, not yet written — next action for the following session.
- Phase 2 (products) and Phase 3 (UI polish + docs) not started.
