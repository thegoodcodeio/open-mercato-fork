# Workflows Module — Agent Guidelines

Use the workflows module for business process automation: defining step-based workflows, executing instances, handling user tasks, processing async activities, and triggering workflows from domain events.

## Always

1. **MUST resolve services via DI** — use `container.resolve('workflowExecutor')`, never import and call lib functions directly
2. **MUST use `workflowExecutor.startWorkflow()`** to create and run instances.
3. **MUST follow the step state machine** — steps transition `PENDING → ACTIVE → COMPLETED|FAILED|SKIPPED|CANCELLED`; never set status out of order
4. **MUST follow the instance state machine** — instances transition `RUNNING → COMPLETED|FAILED|CANCELLED`; intermediate states include `PAUSED`, `WAITING_FOR_ACTIVITIES`, `COMPENSATING`
5. **MUST keep activity handlers idempotent** — check state before mutating; activities may be retried on failure
6. **MUST use event sourcing** — log all workflow events via `eventLogger.logWorkflowEvent()`; never mutate instance state without a corresponding event
7. **MUST use variable interpolation** for dynamic activity config — use `{{context.*}}`, `{{workflow.*}}`, server-allowlisted non-secret `{{env.*}}` keys such as `{{env.APP_URL}}`, and `{{now}}`; never hardcode values or read secrets from `{{env.*}}`
8. **MUST use event triggers, signals, and widget injection** for cross-module integration.
9. **MUST declare new events in `events.ts`** with `as const` — undeclared events trigger TypeScript errors and runtime warnings
10. **MUST scope all queries by `organization_id`** — workflow data is tenant-scoped; never expose cross-tenant instances or tasks

## Ask First

- Ask before changing workflow, step, or activity state machines.
- Ask before changing SSRF guard behavior, private URL allowances, compensation semantics, or trigger storm controls.
- Ask before coupling another module directly to workflow internals.

## Never

- Never import and call workflow lib functions directly instead of resolving DI services.
- Never skip the execution loop or insert `WorkflowInstance` rows directly.
- Never mutate instance state without a corresponding workflow event.
- Never expose cross-tenant workflow instances or tasks.
- Never leave `OM_WORKFLOWS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_URLS` enabled in production.

## Validation Commands

```bash
yarn db:generate
yarn generate
yarn workspace @open-mercato/core build
```

## Execution Architecture

```
Definition → startWorkflow() → Instance → executeWorkflow() loop
                                              ↓
                                    stepHandler.enterStep()
                                              ↓
                              ┌─────────┬─────────┬──────────┐
                           USER_TASK  AUTOMATED  WAIT_FOR_*  END
                              ↓         ↓          ↓          ↓
                           (pause)   transition  (pause)   complete
                                        ↓
                              transitionHandler.executeTransition()
                                        ↓
                              activityExecutor (sync or async)
                                        ↓
                                   next step...
```

- **Sync activities** execute inline and advance the workflow immediately
- **Async activities** enqueue to the `workflow-activities` queue; workflow pauses until the worker completes them and calls `resumeWorkflowAfterActivities()`
- **Compensation** follows the saga pattern — on failure, compensation activities execute in reverse order

## Data Model Constraints

- **WorkflowDefinition** — templates with steps, transitions, triggers, activities. MUST have a unique `workflowId` + `version` pair
- **WorkflowInstance** — running executions. MUST reference a valid definition; MUST track `currentStepId` and `context`
- **StepInstance** — individual step executions. MUST reference parent instance; MUST record `inputData`/`outputData`
- **UserTask** — human-in-the-loop tasks. MUST have `assignedTo` or `assignedToRoles`; MUST respect `dueDate` for SLA tracking
- **WorkflowEvent** — immutable audit log. MUST NOT be updated or deleted after creation
- **WorkflowEventTrigger** — maps domain events to workflow starts. MUST specify `filterConditions` and `contextMapping`

## Step Types

| Step type | When to use |
|-----------|-------------|
| `START` | Entry point — every definition MUST have exactly one |
| `END` | Terminal step — marks workflow as COMPLETED |
| `USER_TASK` | When human approval or data entry is required — pauses until task completion |
| `AUTOMATED` | When the step should execute transition activities immediately and advance |
| `SUB_WORKFLOW` | When invoking a nested workflow definition |
| `WAIT_FOR_SIGNAL` | When the workflow must pause for an external signal (e.g., payment confirmed) |
| `WAIT_FOR_TIMER` | When the workflow must pause for a duration |
| `PARALLEL_FORK` / `PARALLEL_JOIN` | When splitting/merging parallel execution paths |

## Activity Types

| Activity type | When to use |
|---------------|-------------|
| `SEND_EMAIL` | Send templated email via mail service |
| `CALL_API` | Call an internal API endpoint |
| `CALL_WEBHOOK` | Call an external HTTP endpoint (SSRF-guarded via `@open-mercato/shared/lib/url-safety`; `redirect: 'manual'`, 3xx rejected) |
| `UPDATE_ENTITY` | Mutate an entity via the command bus |
| `EMIT_EVENT` | Emit a domain event to the event bus |
| `EXECUTE_FUNCTION` | Run a registered custom function |
| `WAIT` | Delay execution for a configured duration |

## Environment

| Variable | Effect | Default |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `OM_WORKFLOWS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_URLS` | When `1`/`true`/`yes`, bypasses the SSRF guard in `CALL_WEBHOOK` so workflow authors can hit `localhost`, RFC1918, and `.internal` targets. For dev only — MUST remain unset in production. | unset (guard enforced) |
| `OM_WORKFLOWS_ENV_INTERPOLATION_ALLOWLIST` | Comma-separated non-secret process env keys allowed for `{{env.*}}` interpolation in workflow activity config. `APP_URL` is always allowed. Never include secrets. | unset (`APP_URL` only) |

## DI Services

| Token | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `workflowExecutor` | Start, advance, cancel, retry, and resume workflows |
| `stepHandler` | Enter/exit/execute individual steps (called by executor) |
| `transitionHandler` | Find valid transitions and execute them (called by executor) |
| `activityExecutor` | Execute or enqueue activities (called by transition handler) |
| `eventLogger` | Log workflow events for audit trail |

## Adding a New Activity Type

1. Add the type to the `ActivityType` enum in `data/entities.ts`
2. Add a handler case in `lib/activity-executor.ts` → `executeActivityByType()`
3. Add variable interpolation support for any new config fields
4. Add i18n labels in `i18n/en.json` under `workflows.activityTypes`
5. Add form fields in `components/ActivityEditor.tsx` for the visual editor
6. Run `yarn db:generate` if the entity schema changed
7. Test with both sync and async execution modes

## Adding a New Step Type

1. Add the type to the `StepType` enum in `data/entities.ts`
2. Add a handler case in `lib/step-handler.ts` → `executeStep()`
3. Create a React Flow node component in `components/nodes/`
4. Register the node in the visual editor's node type map
5. Add i18n labels in `i18n/en.json` under `workflows.stepTypes`
6. Add icon mapping in `lib/node-type-icons.ts`
7. Run `yarn generate`

## Event Triggers

Configure automatic workflow starts from domain events:

1. Add trigger configuration to a workflow definition's `triggers[]` array
2. The wildcard subscriber (`subscribers/event-trigger.ts`) evaluates all non-internal events
3. Excluded event prefixes: `query_index`, `search`, `workflows`, `cache`, `queue`
4. Configure `filterConditions` to narrow which events match
5. Configure `contextMapping` to extract event payload into workflow context
6. Use `debounceMs` and `maxConcurrentInstances` to prevent trigger storms

### Trigger Sources And Precedence

`loadTriggersForTenant()` (`lib/event-trigger-service.ts`) merges three sources into `UnifiedTrigger`s, each tagged with a `source` discriminator:

| `source` | Origin | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `legacy` | `workflow_event_triggers` rows | Backward compatibility with triggers created before triggers were embedded in definitions |
| `embedded` | `triggers[]` inside a `workflow_definitions` row's `definition` JSONB | What the visual editor and the definitions API write |
| `code` | `triggers[]` on a code-defined workflow in the in-memory registry (`defineWorkflow`) | Projected by `loadCodeTriggers()`; no DB row required (#4425) |

Precedence: **a DB-backed definition wins over its code counterpart.** Any non-deleted `workflow_definitions` row shadows the code projection for the same `workflowId` — including a disabled row, and including a customization whose `triggers[]` was emptied. This preserves `customize` semantics: once an operator materializes a code workflow, the DB row alone decides which triggers are live.

MUST invalidate the trigger cache after any write that changes which source owns a workflow's triggers — `loadTriggersForTenant()` caches per tenant/organization for `TRIGGER_CACHE_TTL` (5 min), so without invalidation the wildcard subscriber keeps matching a stale snapshot:

```typescript
import { invalidateTriggerCache } from '../lib/event-trigger-service'

if (tenantId) invalidateTriggerCache(tenantId, organizationId ?? undefined)
```

This covers definition create/update/delete **and** `POST .../[id]/customize` (code projection → embedded row) and `POST .../[id]/reset-to-code` (embedded row → code projection). Invalidate for the **written row's own** tenant/organization rather than the caller's — `customize` looks an override up by `(workflowId, tenantId)`, so it can revive a row owned by a sibling organization. Omitting `organizationId` clears every organization under the tenant.

## Widget Injection

The module injects an order-approval widget into the sales module:

- Widget: `widgets/injection/order-approval/`
- Spot ID: `sales.document.detail.order:details`
- Mapping: `widgets/injection-table.ts`

When adding new injected widgets, follow this pattern — keep the widget self-contained with a server component (`widget.ts`) and client component (`widget.client.tsx`).

## Key Directories

| Directory | When to modify |

| `api/` | When adding/modifying REST endpoints for definitions, instances, tasks, events, signals |
| `backend/` | When changing admin pages (definition list, visual editor, instance viewer, task inbox) |
| `components/` | When modifying the visual workflow editor (React Flow nodes, edges, dialogs) |
| `data/` | When changing ORM entities, validators, or extensions |
| `examples/` | When adding/updating seed workflow definitions (JSON) |
| `frontend/` | When modifying public-facing workflow pages |
| `i18n/` | When adding/updating translations (en, es, de, pl) |
| `lib/` | When changing core engine logic (executor, handlers, compensation, signals) |
| `subscribers/` | When adding event-driven side effects (trigger evaluation, notifications) |
| `widgets/` | When adding cross-module UI injection (e.g., approval widgets) |
| `workers/` | When modifying the async activity worker |
