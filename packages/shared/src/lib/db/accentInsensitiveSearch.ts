 * resolves its text-search dictionary through `search_path`, and a STABLE
 * function cannot appear in an index expression. The wrapper pins the dictionary
 * with `'public.unaccent'::regdictionary` so it is genuinely immutable rather
 * than merely declared so — but the wrapper's own *call site* is still resolved
 * through `search_path` unless it is schema-qualified too, so both the index
 * expression and the runtime query predicate reference `public.` explicitly
 * rather than relying on the caller's `search_path` containing it.
